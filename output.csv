"Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary.

But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study.

"Hello. Before going into the progress of scoliosis, I would like to make you some clarity about the facts on it. 1) The Cobb angle is a measure of the curvature of the spine in degrees. This helps to determine what type of treatment is necessary.

"Hello. Before going into the progress of scoliosis, I would like to make you some clarity about the facts on it. 1) The Cobb angle is a measure of the curvature of the spine in degrees. This helps to determine what type of treatment is necessary. A Cobb angle of 10 degrees is regarded as a minimum angulation to define scoliosis. 2) A scoliosis curve of 10 to 15 degrees normally does not require any treatment except for regular check-ups. 3) If the scoliosis curve is 20 to 40 degrees, the orthopedic doctor will prescribe a back brace help to keep the spine from developing more of a curve. 4) More than 45 degrees need correction surgery keeping many pedicle screw and osteotomy to correct the curve.

"Hello. There are different types of power chains that are available for the treatment depending on the interlink space. 1. Short (connects every alternate bracket). 2. Long (connects every third bracket). 3. Closed (connects each bracket). So depending on the stage of your treatment, either of the types can be used which may or may not connect individual brackets.

"Hello. Premature atrial contractions or supraventricular ectopics are not harmful per se other than giving you symptoms. So antiarrhythmics are not usually recommended, so I do not disagree with your treating cardiologist. Beta blocker is the safest option available, although not the most effective one and other options are ablation or antiarrhrythmics. So trying behavioral techniques is a good option. But if it troubles you a lot then you may request low dose antiarrhythmics like Amiodarone for a short period of time, but they may again come back after the drug is stopped. Since there is no atrial fibrillation or SVT (supraventricular tachycardia), antiarrhythmics are absolutely necessary, but the benefit would be in you is just symptomatic, which comes with the risk of side effects. However, you should have Holter at regular intervals like yearly (with echo for aortic regurgitation), or if you notice sustained ectopics or irregular rhythm implying development of fibrillation. You may discuss changing Atenolol to others like Metoprolol and see if its help. You should try to identify triggers like sleep or gastric disturbances, alcohol or smoking (if any), any particular medications (which you are on), stress, etc. Also, if not had recently, thyroid should be tested. So in a nutshell, antiarrhythmics may be avoided, but if not tolerable symptomatically then may be tried. I hope this helps.  ","Hello doctor,  I am a 60-year-old male who just received the results of a 24-hour Holter monitor. Key findings include: Sinus rhythm with frequent supraventricular ectopy (2559) which included couplets and one seven beat SVE multiplet. No complex forms. No significant pauses or periods of heart block noted. Constant feeling of missed beats coincides with frequent supraventricular ectopy. Very infrequent ventricular ectopy that was isolated and univocal. Cardiologists not concerned with findings and recommended positive affirmation, distraction, and cognitive behavioral strategies. He was very reluctant to recommend anti-arrhythmic treatment seeing this as overkill. Other matters of interest.

"Hello, Welcome to ilciniq.com. Please attach the ECG report, it is not attached. Please clarify, whether the pain is prominent feature or inability to move the arm, or is it like that she is not able to move arm because of pain or fear of pain. Now, this is not indicative of heart disease. Left arm pain without chest pain is unlikely to be related to the heart. Also, there would not be any difficulty in moving the arm with a heart attack. So it is unlikely to be related to the heart. The possibilities are, one is cervical and second is shoulder problems like frozen shoulder, or arm dislocation, even if there is no history of obvious trauma (frozen shoulder is more lifely). So she will need, 1. ECG (electrocardiography) to be sure. 2. X-ray of shoulder AP/lateral view and maybe cervical spine if having symptoms. Next, the pulse oximeter will not helpful in ruling out heart disease. However, if she has severe shortness of breath and low oxygen reading then this may indicate heart failure, so indirectly we may infer. However, if the pain is mild and weakness is prominent then it is probably either cervical issue or neurological issue. So get her examined by local doctor and x-ray done.

"Hello. I can understand you must be very upset about your father's health. Well, you see the abdominal pain in such age is often an alarming finding, and I urge you to get him some investigations before giving any blanket cover of medicines. Common possibilities in his age are: 1. Mesenteric ischemia, which is the narrowing of the blood vessel supplying the blood to abdominal organs. This can frequently occur in old age with diabetes and hypertension. The pain arises because of lack of blood supply to organs like small bowel, large bowel, and others. 2. The second possibility is pain due to any organ within the abdomen which is inflamed commonly the pancreas (a gland over the back of the tummy), and large bowel. 3. And lastly, since he has a problem with constipation the gas accumulation can also be the reason of his abdominal pain. But remember, we cannot say that it is because of gas distension unless we exclude all other possibilities which are more concerning. I suggest you to get investigations which I write below. Only after the investigation, we can be able to diagnose the problem and treat it appropriately. I really hope this set of investigations will help us to approach the problem correctly.

"Hello.  As you have not mentioned the date of your last menstrual period, I am assuming by day 0 you mean the starting date of last menstrual cycle. Because we calculate the pregnancy age from that date. So yes, the early pregnancy time is very important because the embryo is developing in that time period. So as per your query, as you mentioned the consumption of wine in the early three weeks, I do not think it is gonna have any effect on the embryo because it is in the preovulatory phase when even the egg is being formed and released. And yes, corticosteroid in high doses when used for chronic medical conditions can have a risk of cleft lip and palate, but a single shot taken for an allergic reaction should not be affecting the baby. Also, the Flucloxacillin is a penicillin group of drug which is usually safe in pregnancy. So be calm and stop worrying about the risks. It will just increase your stress levels. Moreover in early pregnancy, if any embryo is grossly affected by any insult, it either usually aborts early if the exposure has been hazardous, but if the exposure is nonhazardous, it makes through and the baby will be fine. This is called all or none phenomenon in pregnancy. So your exposure to the medications was not that is something very dangerous, so rest assured. And more over your pregnancy has reached until 6 weeks, that is a good sign that the embryo has not been affected by the exposure to the drugs you have been worrying about.

NT (nuchal) scan with dual marker test between 11-13 weeks. Routine antenatal investigations as per your local protocols. Tablet Folic Acid 5 mg daily once after food until 13-14 weeks. Avoid sexual intercourse until 14 weeks. Consult your gynecologist before any medications intake or to review the medications already taking for chronic medical conditions.

"Hello. I can imagine that you must be very concerned about your persistent elevation of the liver enzymes.

"Hello. I went through your query and the attached image (attachment removed to protect patient identity). You have two lower second premolars extracted with no third molars in the lower jaw. Little bit crowding is seen in both upper lateral incisors that might be the reason for you opting for braces. Well, as a specialist upper tooths have a little bit of space in between the central incisors. Upper front teeth need proximal slicing to facilitate space that space will be enough to realign your both upper lateral to the arch. Although it is just a front profile if possible upload a side profile of your face to evaluate the overjet but I can say just marginal and proximal slicing of the upper front teeth will be enough, and no further extraction needed. Meanwhile, you have missing both lower second premolars. Get a fixed bridge to cover the gaps or else they will shift and get malaligned. Upper third molar are also fine and does not need extraction in the near future. Go for normal braces instead of Invisalign. Normal braces work much better in these cases.  I hope this helps.

It has been almost seven weeks and I still have not had my period yet. I had unprotected sex on May 24 thinking my ovulation day is over but I started getting very paranoid last week. So I took a pregnancy test on June 10th and it was negative. Then I took one more yesterday on June 14th and it was negative, but if I squinted hard enough it could have been positive. I am very paranoid right now because I do not have a supportive family and I do not have health insurance to go to the doctor to get this checked out, and I am not ready to have a child. I am 21 years old living with my very conservative religious immigrant parents and I do not know if I should take the second pregnancy test seriously. I have been stressed out for the past one month which makes me think I am skipping a month but I am still very afraid that there is a chance I may be pregnant. I have no symptoms of pregnancy. Is it likely that I am pregnant?"
"Hi. Acne is very common in one's teens and twenties. Some continue to have breakouts even later in their life especially if there are some underlying hormonal issues or genetic predisposition. Pimples develop because of increased sebum secretion, inflammation, and bacteria residing on the skin called P. acnes has an important role to play. Treatment requires knowing your detailed history, any hormonal issues, any treatments you have taken in the past, products you use on your face, etc. Oral medicines and creams/gels are used for the treatment of acne. For mild eruptions, creams containing Clindamycin and Nicotinamide may be used. Benzoyl peroxide and Adapalene are other commonly prescribed anti-acne applications. But it is important to discuss with a dermatologist to decide on the correct line of treatment. Meanwhile, eat healthily, avoid excess milk and dairy, chocolates, and junk food. Exercise regularly and sleep well. Also, avoid using oil or greasy applications on the scalp and face and keep cosmetic use to a minimum. I hope this helps.  ","Hello doctor, I am getting increasing acne day by day. How to prevent them from coming on my face?"

"Hello, I have gone through his reports. So he has hypertension and he needs to be on medication for long term. However in future with weight loss and healthy lifestyle like avoiding fatty oily and high calorie food, plenty of green vegetables and fruits etc. his requirement for antihypertensive may go down. So his future BP readings would guide regarding that, but as of now he should be on regular BP medications with regular BP monitoring. Best BP readings would be 110 to 130 systolic and less than 90 diastolic. Now regarding Ecg and echo, firstly they are all hypertensive changes and not worrisome. Concentric LVH would be there even if BP is under control and it's not going to cause any problems. ECG doesn't show complete RBBB, however there are early RBBB changes which are again likely related to hypertension and not worrisome. Sinus arrhythmia is normal finding and nothing to worry to about prolonged P wave. So there are changes which are not very significant and alarming. So in a nutshell, he should focus on BP control, healthy lifestyle, get his lipid profile tested and he should be subjected to treadmill test after age of 40 years.

"Hello. Yes, excess weight does cause a hormonal disturbance that can lead to delayed periods. But there can be other hormonal changes like thyroid and prolactin that need to be evaluated to look for the cause of the delayed periods. Sometimes stress also can cause a delay. And yes, the consistency of the discharge can be a little thicker during the premenstrual phase if ovulation happens, but we cannot predict just based on that if you would be getting your periods or not. If already three months have lapsed, and if there is no chance for a pregnancy, then it would be advisable to take medication for withdrawal and get yourself evaluated for the irregular menstrual cycle issues.

"Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com. Your ECG is fine (attachment removed to protect patient identity). There are no significant abnormalities seen in ECG (electrocardiogram). Machine generated report mentioned at the top is frequently inaccurate so not to get panic with it. Now in cardiac pain, the pain usually occurs on exertion and relieves with rest. This is very classical of cardiac pain if it persists for a few minutes and does not last round the clock more than 1-2 days. Now if the pain does not have such characteristic then it may either be related to cervical spondylosis or gastric reflux. If you have any bloating, burping, heartburn, or upper abdominal pain, then it may be related to gastric reflux. Or if this pain increases on neck movements, associated with tingling, numbness sensation in arms then it may be related to cervical pain. However, considering the risk factors like DM (diabetes mellitus), HTN (hypertension), it is better to rule out the possibility of cardiac pain. So you should undergo echo and if normal then treadmill test.  ","Hello doctor, I have chest pain for more than one month, on and off radiating to neck and jaw sometimes.

"Hello. Now if you are having symptoms at present, then you will need an antibiotic course for it, and treatment of choice is Amoxicillin clavulanate combination for five days. You should also have Betadine gargles four times a day for five days. Presence of pus does mean it is likely a bacterial infection, may not be strep but other bacterias. Now regarding the preventive aspect, firstly there is no reliable way of preventing it other than tonsillectomy. So you should consider this option if this is becoming troublesome for you. Now some points which would help to catch the infection are maintaining hand and oral hygiene, avoiding too cold foods which usually precipitates the infection. You should try to identify the triggers which have precipitated the infection last time like cold foods, street foods, or other triggers. You should consider the use of Chlorhexidine mouth wash on a regular basis. Next thing, you should have Betadine gargles with you. With the earliest symptoms of sore throat, you should start gargling four times a day which would prevent the progression to frank infection. If your diet is not good then you may consider having a course of multivitamins for two weeks, otherwise not necessary. I hope this helps.  ","Hi doctor, I have been dealing with a recurring sore throat for the past couple of months. My tonsils get sore and swollen with pus and usually, I have a canker sore-like lesion on them as well.

"Hi. I can understand your concern. According to your statement, you have been suffering from erectile dysfunction for the last few days. Erectile dysfunction is usually caused by low blood flow to the penis or problems of nerve of penis which control erections. Most common cause of erectile dysfunction is psychological reasons such as stress or depression. It may have resulted from the hardening of arteries, high blood pressure, high blood glucose, high cholesterol, medications, BPH, prostatitis, hormonal disturbances, etc. Usually, erectile dysfunction is common in everyone's life due to many causes.

You can do some investments like CBC (complete blood count), urine R/M/E, RBS (random blood sugar), lipid profile, USG of W/A, PSA, etc and hormonal tests such as testosterone, LH, prolactin, thyroid function test, etc., to find out the underlying the causes which are responsible for your present sufferings and then treat them accordingly.

"Hello. I feel very sorry to hear about your husband, and very rightly understand your concern and temptation for his unresolving symptoms. You are perfectly right that if treatment were given rightly he should have shown some improvement but unfortunately he did until now. So considering all the information you provided to me, there are few possibilities. First of all, is typhoid fever which is a bacterial infection. The second is intestinal amebiasis which is a parasitic infection. Typhoid seems to be likely possibly given his almost 10 days of fever, and in second week, he started to develop abdominal pain which is suggestive of typhoid ulcers in small bowel. I would suggest him an antibiotic course for at least 10 days, and a maximum of 14 days which would cover both potential bugs. I also want that you get him some blood and stool tests before starting antibiotic course. The antibiotic course is relatively safe. I also want that you closely examine his chest for the development of rose spots. They are very small pinkish marks which develop among patient over the chest in the second week of the illness. Do not worry they are harmless, it is just a manifestation. I really hope his symptoms will improve like a fever would start settle, and abdominal pain should resolve in the next 48 to 72 hours of the start of the antibiotic regimen. I would also want to know the assessment/prescription of a previous doctor who said about colopathy. The colopathy is a very broad and vague term which means colon (large bowel) inflammation. It has a number of causes the one is painkillers (NSAIDs) and recently COVID 19 has shows some case reports with colopathy. But if your family and he himself does not have any contact history to COVID 19 positive or suspected case, then the possibility is very rare. Ultrasound is not a sensitive investigation for the disease which involves the bowel lumen such as in your husband's case. Ultrasound is more helpful in disease involving liver, spleen, or gall bladder. So it is not uncommon to have a normal ultrasound with conditions like typhoid fever or intestinal amebiasis. So I am writing him antibiotics for 10 days now if the improvement is shown we would increase up to 14 days. I really hope with this course his symptoms will start settling in the next 48 to 72 hours. And lastly, get some blood and stool tests as I suggest her and discuss the reports once they are available. Typhoid fever. Intestinal amebiasis. C. difficle infection. Colopathy. Complete blood count. Blood culture and sensitivity (before starting antibiotic course). IHA titer for E. Histolytica. Stool detail report and ova parasites. Stool for fecal calprotectin. Stool for C.difficle infection and stool for culture and Sensitivity (before starting antibiotic course). You can ask him to give sample today and start antibiotics just after giving the sample. Capsule Cefixime 400 mg twice daily for 10 days, tablet Flagyl 400 mg thrice daily for seven days (this antibiotic can cause metallic taste in mouth and or decreased appetite) for that you can give him tablet Levosulpiride 25 mg thrice daily half hour before meals for nausea, appetite. Take home cooked meals, take good amount of water, mineral water if possible (both infections are acquired after a contaminated food or water). See me after labs, and earlier if any further concern.  ","Hello doctor, My 59-year-old husband has had a fever for about 10 days, the first two days it varied between 37.8 and 38.8 maximum and small diarrhea without any other symptoms.

"Hi. CT KUB (kidneys, ureter, and bladder) is 95% accurate to diagnose urinary stones. Usually, stones form in the kidney and drop down the ureter causing extreme pain due to stretch of the renal capsule. Since your right kidney is blocked, I need to check on your kidney functions by doing a blood test called creatinine level, especially if you have other medical problems like diabetes or hypertension. I also want to make sure you do not have urinary infections after this if kidney functions are normal and no infection then we can try medical therapy for 4-6 weeks with capsule Tamsulosin (Contiflo) 0.4 mg at night daily for six weeks the possibility of passing the stone is 25%. If you need more urgent treatment with a 70% stone clearance rate will be shock wave lithotripsy. If you got pain again in spite of medication or you got high creatinine level then endoscopic ureteroscopy DJ stent will be the best first-line option. On follow up after treatment you need needs calcium level, phosphate, and uric acid. I hope this helps. Creatinine, urine analysis, and culture. Hydration lemon and orange fresh juices.

"Hello. Well the pain which comes in or worsen after doing physical movements is highly likely secondary to muscle and bone related. The pain of peptic ulcer however can be knawing and usually worsens after meals. But given the fact that you have been using Omeprazole which is a strong acid suppressant, is helpful in healing peptic ulcer; the presence of peptic ulcers in your stomach seems to be a rare possibility.  1.

My question is do you have symptoms like difficulty in passing urine? Or pain while passing urine? If not then did you have urine culture result before your antibiotics treatment? If you have documented UTI before and you got treated then you have pus cells and white cells in urine, your test might have been performed soon after antibiotics. The possibilities are incomplete treatment or chronic inflammation of the urinary bladder as sending infections are also common in postmenopausal period. You will need to follow up with urine culture test, if it is negative and you have no symptoms then no need to treat. If it is negative and you are still having symptoms (pain while passing urine), we need to do more tests. I hope to follow up you after urine culture results. As preventive measure, you need proper hydration, cranberry juice, yogurt and proper hygiene. Cystitis, incomplete treatment. Urine culture. Cystitis bacterial, TB. Cystitis. Observation and hydration. Hydration cranberry juice, yogurt. 4 days after urine culture.  ","Hello doctor, I have recurring UTI. Last time,a few months back, after taking medicines for the recurring UTI, results were normal. I took Cital syrup and antibiotics. After experiencing pain recently I again went for urine test, and it shows RBC, epithelial cells and bacteria. I have attached the reports. I was consulting a gynecologist prior to this, but she told me to consult a urologist. I have attached my last ultrasound and kidney function test along with today's urine test."

"Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help.  ","Hello doctor, I have multiple small cysts in both ovaries (PCOS).

"Hello. I can imagine you must be very upset about your pain. Well the pain of appendicitis should be continues and not intermittent. Pain starts at the center of the abdomen around umbilicus and travel to the right lower part of the abdomen. Pain of appendicitis is often unbearable accompany with vomiting or severe constipation and sometimes diarrhea. Now I think you can better figure out what sort of pain is this. Gas bloating can cause pain but not often severe and usually occur when one have a meal not otherwise. The pain improves with fasting or taking a certain diet which does not produce excessive gases. Pain of gas often worsens after milk and dairy products intake. If you feel a strong suspicion for appendicitis an ultrasound abdomen targeted for appendicitis would be the first best investigation to do. I hope this helps. Abdominal pain. Complete blood count. Serum amylase. Liver function tests. Ultrasound abdomen for liver, gall bladder, and appendix. Functional gas and bloating. Capsule Tramadol 100 mg for pain until definite treatment is given.  ","Hi doctor,  I am having abdominal pain on my lower right stomach since yesterday and my parents thought it is just the only bloated stomach. I cannot also urinate well and pass stools. Whenever I pass stools my lower right abdominal get hurt so badly. Is this appendicitis or other stomach disease?"
"Hello. Yes, you should definitely start the treatment. But I want you to get a baseline renal function tests and fibroscan of the liver. If renal functions are normal then we can start and continue the treatment at the maximum dose. You can use tablet Tenofovir 300 mg once daily. If the renal function tests are normal. I would urge you to get a fibroscan and alpha-fetoprotein AFP. If you are married then please get your wife and children tested. I want to know about your rest or family like your sibling, mother, and father. Is any family history of hepatitis B? It is important because screening has to be performed in case there is suspicion of vertical transmission (from mother to fetus). You can get the tests and see me afteward to discuss the reports of tests and provide other information related to your family. I may then suggest testing for them. Lastly, I remember that hepatitis B cannot be completely cured but can be substantially controlled with antiviral medicines. It requires follow up and guidance. Chronic hepatitis B, HBeAg positive disease. AFP (alpha fetoprotein). Fibroscan of liver. Follow up to discuss the relevant family history and to discuss the lab reports.

"Hi. From the information given it seems you are experiencing the early signs of male pattern hair loss. This is a very common condition and there are many factors responsible, one of them being genetic. If you have other family members with similar patterned hair loss the chances for you to develop it increase too. Due to the effect of the male hormone on the hair cycle, over a period of time, the hair follicle starts shrinking and so the hair which comes out is thinner and more fragile and breaks easily. Also, the growing phase of the hair is shortened, so your hair does not grow as long it used to and becomes shorter and wispier. Being just 17 years old I am sure it must be worrying you a lot. But do not be disheartened. There are several treatment options available and the sooner we start the treatment the better the chances of reducing further hair loss, thinning, and increasing regrowth. A combination of oral supplements to boost hair growth along with application of lotions containing Minoxidil 5% to begin with will be the best course of action in my opinion. Oral Finasteride, which is the male hormone blocker, is used frequently. Applications with Finasteride are available too. This will be prescribed by your treating doctor after assessing the extent of thinning and discussing the side effects, etc. Several preparations of bio-peptides and other natural ingredients like saw palmetto extract, melatonin, etc are also available to boost the hair growth. PRP (platelet-rich plasma) is a popular procedure which is often used in combination with medical treatment to stimulate hair growth further. Usually, a combination of treatments is suggested after the clinical evaluation. But using the applications regularly is the key to good results. Hair regrowth takes a few months to show and you will have to be patient to see the benefit of the treatment. I hope this helps.  ","Hi doctor,  I am a 17-year-old male. Since I started to grow my hair, I began to realize how thin it is naturally. Is there any way to thicken it up? But the main concern is that since I have grown it, I started to experience excessive shedding. By only passing my hand on my head I would get on average 15 hairs. The pattern stopped for a while, but my hair is thinning a lot on the sides. I can see across my scalp easily by lifting the hairs on the side of my head, (lateral sides, on top of ears, and the regular pattern baldness zones). It has become excessively thin. Please help."
"Good Day, I am Dr. David. Since when did you exactly notice the lump? Did it grow in size since then. Any change of color on the skin over the lump? Did you notice dimpling of the skin over it? And is it painful when you touch it? I would also like to know if you have relatives that also had this? If most of your answers are ""yes"" i suggest to say to your parents that you have to see a surgeon right away to be evaluated. If not i will still suggest you to see a surgeon, but you can take your time. Lumps should be evaluated properly and will be treated accordingly depending on the physical findings. Base on your findings it might be a lump of fat cells that formed. But still a good evaluation would tell us more. Thank you. If you have further questions you may message me here.

"Hello. I can imagine the level of your frustration regarding your weight. Yes, it is nearly impossible to keep reduce weight and maintain diet and exercise. I may not be able to give you a composite plan of action for your weight reduction since it is not basically a one day consultation task. In fact, it is a long term commitment towards yourself and towards a multidisciplinary team inclusive of a dietician, bariatric endoscopist (gastroenterologist), behavioral therapist, and lastly a bariatric surgeon. So I would give you facts and figures for the existing evidence of weight reduction therapies. Remember your current body mass index BMI is 34.3. The goal of any weight reduction treatment is to reduce weight to optimal ranges where the physical and psychological well being of a person is maintained. Now anybody whose body mass index (BMI) is more than 40 should straight away consider bariatric intervention in the form of endoscopic or surgical modality. And anybody whose BMI is 35 but having other conditions such as uncontrolled diabetes, coronary artery disease (heart disease) or lung dysfunction (lung hypertension and sleep disorders) should undergo interventions. But you see not all person fit into above category. Many have BMI less than 35 (such as in your case) and having very troubling symptoms, among such people individualized approach is employed whether medicinal use or endoscopic or surgical intervention. Diets and regular weight reduction exercises do help to reduce weight by 7 to 10%. All medicines which are currently in use help reduce weight by 10 to 20%. Certain endoscopic bariatric procedures such as balloon placement in stomach and sleeve gastrectomy does help reduce weight around 25% And lastly, surgical procedures such as metallic rings around the stomach via laparoscopy and surgical sleeve gastrectomy, and surgical Roux Y bypass, help to reduce weight by 30 to 35%. The figures are ranges, they vary significantly in individual cases. I also want you to understand, that these interventions should be accompanied with optimal dieting and exercise even after surgery or medicinal therapy. Otherwise, the weight can frequently recur to original ones. This above description is only to make you understand and figure out things. I can recommend you to start with dieting (keeping your calories well below 1500 Kcal daily), running, swimming, and weight lifting on a regular basis. I also suggest you to meet a dietician on icliniq or otherwise in person, to get a diet plan with respect to your calorie requirement. I can suggest you some medicinal treatment, but they are prescription medicine, may not be OTC, and the course has to be taken for at least six months to see the effect. Naltrexone/Bupropion (Contrave) is proven and FDA approved and can be started in your case. But I want you to provide more information about your health, as I can assess your condition first and treat aimfully rather adding more harm to your health. Because these medications have some side effects and they should be kept in mind before giving it therapeutically. I also want to know about family support, any occupational therapist available near your vicinity, your current job status, and medical health insurance, and also information whether the cost of these medicines is covered or not. Until that time you follow up, I want you to get the following blood tests to better know the impact of your obesity on bodily systems. I hope this helps. Obesity. Complete blood count. TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone), FT3, FT4. Liver function test. Fasting lipid profile. Serum CRP (C-reactive protein). Albumin total protein and AG ratio. Arterial blood gases. Urine detail report, and urine for albumin. Will decide after further information is provided and after investigation thoroughly for any underlying metabolic complications.  ","Hello doctor, I am tired of being fat and I am tired of diets. After a diet, I gain double and every time it is harder to lose. I am desperate, lonely, and depressed.

"Hi! I had a look at the picture you have sent. This looks like more of a Chronic pharyngitis. The red spot you have pointed out is more of a lymphoid follicle which has slightly increased in size and is present in almost all of us. There is nothing that you need to worry about as this is a very common entity we come across and is treatable. You can consider following the advice mentioned below  Drugs mentioned in point 1,2 and 3 can be taken only if there is an acute infection associated with pain while swallowing. If there is no pain or infection the medication mentioned in 1,2 and 3 are not required. Make sure you follow points in 4, 5 and 6 as long as possible as this prevents the possibility of developing a throat infection. There is absolutely nothing to worry about the red spot over there as it doesnt indicate any cancer or malignancy and is only a lymphoid follicle which has increased in size due to possible previous throat infections. I hope I have answered your query in detail. If there is anything more you want to know or enquire, please let us know and we will get back to you ASAP. Please take care Warm regards  ",I have Granular Pharyngitis problems 60 days Plz help me medicine name?
"Hi. I can understand your concern. According to your statement, you have been suffering from clogged earaches with painful jaw joints and sore throat with vertigo and all these sufferings may result from herpes infection according to your assumption. When herpes affects the nerve in the face that spreads to ear known as Herpes zoster oticus its clinical features are severe earaches, swelling of vestibular nerve, fluid-filled vesicles on outside of ear and inside ear canal, permanent or temporary paralysis of the face with hearing loss. Again herpes esophagitis can attack the mouth. Sores may develop in the mouth and make swelling difficult due to inflammation of the throat. This pain can radiate to mouth and jaws. Sudden hearing loss can result commonly from viral infections other than herpes are measles, mumps, rubella, viral meningitis, syphilis, AIDS, etc., which can cause sudden loss of hearing. Again bacterial meningitis, Lyme, any tumors in the ear can also be hearing loss. Any type of hearing loss, steroid should be applied immediately. It helps in reducing the inflammation and decrease the swelling and increasing hearing ability. So along with your current medications, you should use steroids immediately to prevent further hearing loss. In case of any other query knock me and I will try to help u further.

Hello. As you have described in your history it is looking like an infection in your eyes. Can you please send your eye image to me? So that I can get an exact idea about your condition and depend upon that we can plan further. It is better if I can see your eye condition and then prescribe you drops. So my advice is to please attach your eye image as soon as possible so that we can start your treatment as early as possible and you will feel better after treatment.  ,"Hello doctor, My eyes are swollen especially in the morning. I find it hard to open my eyes after a nap or when I wake up in the morning. After that, I am fine during the day with watery eyes sometimes. No itching but it is little reddish when it is hot. Around the first week of March, I went to see an opthalmologist who told me I had a bacterial infection of both eyes. I was prescribed Vigamox and after seven days my eyes were fine. Due to quarantine, I was not able to go back to my doctor. Around the last week of April, I had the same symptoms and since I cannot go out I treated my eyes with Vigamox again and was healed after seven days. After that from time to time, I have swelling, not much but mostly in the morning. I am a 68-year-old female. I have allergies, seafood, pollen, and dust. I take Allerta or Claritin from time to time to relieve my allergies. I smoke but I am trying to quit, before 6 to 10 sticks, now reduced to four or five."
"Hello. I understand your concern here and you are right that there are not many or in fact hardly any articles or peer-reviewed papers on Melatonin and birth control interactions. But I would like to keep it simple for you to understand. Melatonin is produced during the night to ease the sleep pattern in humans post-sunset with maximum levels at 9 PM and by morning 9 AM, the levels found are almost negligible. So, it is produced by the pineal gland in the dark cycle and metabolized at night by the liver. Now liver also is known to metabolize the birth control pills be it progesterone-only or combinations pills. Hence, if taken together then there is a likelihood of slower metabolism of either compound and thereby prolonged residual effect may be seen on concurrent use of pills and Melatonin together. The effects could be prolonged sleepiness and also Melatonin induced increased progesterone levels in the body causing bloating and noticeable progestogenic side effects. However, the efficacy or effectiveness of the pill is not compromised but metabolism is delayed as Melatonin competes with the pill with the liver. So ideally the better way would be to switch the POP in the morning hours and the Melatonin pill at night 12 hours apart. This would prevent any interference with either action on the body or cause any interaction.  ","Hello doctor, I have read that Melatonin could possibly lessen the effectiveness of birth control pills. My understanding is that there is little to no peer-reviewed scientific studies to support this claim, but I am still worried, as I am sexually active and take 3 mg of Melatonin each night (and I am on the progestin-only pill). I am looking for a doctor to weigh in on this issue."
"Hello. It is important in your case to rule out the possibility of pelvic inflammatory disease. Now points in favor are history of chlamydia and UTI in the past, pain on deep penetration and tenderness on the left side of abdomen. These are the sufficient point to evaluate for the possibility of PID (pelvic inflammatory disease). I guess you do not have any discharge per vaginum may be scanty. One more thing is, just try to see if you are having this pain from the beginning from the intercourse or started after some time. Because if it is from the beginning then this may be dyspareunia and not related to PID. But if it has developed later then it becomes important that you undergo evaluation for PID. You will need an ultrasound of pelvis, CRP (C-reactive protein) or ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate), vaginal fluid smear. However, the vaginal examination will also be helpful to see whether there is any cervical motion tenderness, which would give a fair idea about the possibility. It is important to rule out PID because it can have consequences later like fertility issues. So if we get any clues regarding it then you will need a course of antibiotic treatment. I hope this helps.  ","Hello doctor, I only have one sexual partner for almost a year. However, during intercourse, I feel that I am having a pain in my pelvic area and it is a sudden sharp pain. Sometimes it is random or happens during deeper penetration. It feels like pressure and almost seems like it is gas but I am not sure what it is that I am experiencing. A while back, I had a UTI and since then I have been experiencing this at times. Sometimes it does not bother me. I just want to make sure I am fine or see if this is a concern that I need to come in. Yesterday, I experienced the pressure pain on my left side more and it drew enough for concern.

Hello Dear. I welcome you to icliniq. I feel very sorry for his pain.

Hello Your complaints of pain related to the hernia needs to be examined . If there is no complications within the herni In normal circumstances I would suggest all hernia should be operated but since you are having exams you can delay the surgery given that on physical examination and ultrasound you do not have any complications. For the time being as a temporary measure you can use what is called as a TRUS available in the market even online . But it is temporary and once you are free fork your exams I suggest you to get operated there after as TRUS or any other treatment is just temporary and has its own pro and cons. But if on ultrasound it shows you have any complication the you need immediate surgery. Avoid lifting heavy weights add fiber rich food to your diet and avoid constipation to prevent exacerbation of your hernia. Hope this helps  ,"Hi sir, I'm an 18 year old boy.

Hello. I have gone through all your reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity) and your prolactin and thyroid levels are well in control. What is missing in the follicular monitoring profile of the dummy cycle and also your husband's semen analysis test? You have been following the correct protocol using LH kits for ovulation and post LH surge if a natural trial or timed intercourse did not work then husband's semen analysis becomes mandatory. Then when both male and female infertility causes are ruled out then comes mechanical causes where positions and version of uterus need to be considered and measures implemented. Anyways please send these two remaining reports before we can proceed further.  ,"Hello doctor, I am not able to conceive after trying for almost one year. I was diagnosed with pituitary microadenoma and I am on medication. My prolactin levels have now reached normal levels after two months taking medication. I suffer from hypothyroidism and on medication. I have had this for five years now and it is well within the limits as per my endocrinologist now. This is due to an autoimmune disease where my TPO (thyroid peroxidase) antibodies were high during the diagnosis five years ago. My husband and I would like to know how should we best prepare for pregnancy and what to look out for. We would have preferred to visit the clinic. Unfortunately, I am not in a position to visit the doctor due to travel restrictions. It would be great to get in touch with a specialist. I am currently on Euthrox 100 mcg, Cabergoline 0.25 mg once a week, and Folic acid 450 mg daily."

"Hello. I can understand your concern. According to your statement, you have been suffering from throbbing headaches during waking up. Headache which is throbbing in nature may result from the dilation of blood vessels from increased blood flow. Headache is very common in everyone life. Strenuous work, stressful life, dehydration, anxieties, tension, common cold, allergies, low glucose sugar level, etc., can cause headaches. Throbbing headaches may result from some health conditions such as migraines. Throbbing headache occurs at the top of head, Cluster headache occurs as throbbing headache behind the eyes, Occipital neuralgia presents as throbbing headache at the back of headache, Temporal arteritis occurs as throbbing headache in temples, Hemicrania continua occurs as throbbing headache on one side. Treatment depends on the causes. You should undergo some investigations like CBC (complete blood count), x-ray PNS (paranasal sinus) can detect the cause which is responsible for your sufferings and then treat them accordingly. You can take for your headache as follows. Tablet Inderal (Propronolol) (40mg) 0+0+1 for 15 days, Naprosyn (Naproxen) (500 mg) 1+0+1 for 10 days, Prevacid (Lansoprazole) (30 mg) 1+0+0 for 15 days. In case of allergy or cold take tablet Allegra (Fexofenadine) (120 mg) 0+0+1 for 10 days. In case of any other query knock me.  ","Hello doctor, I woke up with a throbbing headache. Previously I was alright before going to sleep which was around 2 AM. Lately, I have been sleeping very late due to working at home for long hours. Please help."
"Hello. Hematospermia (blood in semen), is fairly common. Generally it is not considered as a sinister sign. There are whole list of possibilities for this theoretically, but once we ensure it is not due to sinister cause and rule out treatable causes say like infections we do not beyond that as it will not affect the management. Sinister causes mainly prostate and testicular cancers. At your age prostate cancer is extremely unlikely but need to ensure no testicular problem. With your symptoms with testes, you need another scan to be on safe side as the scope for examination to be conclusive. I suspect you have epidydimal cysts which are very common and can cause pain, etc. So if the scan does not show anything other than this, I would not worry about it at all. I think the rash is completely unrelated to this or any of your urological problems. Nor the rash or hematospermia is related to old history of chlamydia. Since you have not had any other urinary symptom, I would not worry much about other tests related to urinary tract. However, I would also recommend sending semen for culture to see any infection in it. Lastly about prostate cancer virtually unheard in your age. Finger examination of prostate, PSA blood test and MRI scans of prostate are the screening tests in general. But not something I would recommend if testes scan comes back normal and if you are still worried an MRI then will be helpful as last resort. Idiopathic. Testicular pathology. Ultrasound scan of testes. Ideally an examination of genitals including prostate by a clinician. Semen culture. Idiopathic. Hematospermia. With reports.  ","Hello doctor, I am a 33-year-old male. I have not had any previous health problems, non-smoker, and non-drinker. Generally, I am feeling fine. For the past six months, I have produced bloody semen with blood clots and producing more recently. I have also recently started feeling mild pain behind my right testicle. Occasionally, my left testicles seem to change in size slightly and seem to almost disappear and the right testicle becomes quite tender and firm. I had an ultrasound scan about six years ago and there was found some cyst but little concern. About a week ago, I sensed a small lump rising above my right testicle to my lower abdomen, it was uncomfortable but I slept and the discomfort eventually went away. I see little blood-colored spots appearing on my arms and torso perhaps resembling perhaps petechiae and have an area of this rash on my torso that I am not sure may be related to my concern? I have been taking Azithromycin since yesterday incase it may be a virus or something bacterial but it does not seem to be helping the problem. I had a blood test in January 2020, but have not been able to make a follow-up blood test yet. Not sure why it might be necessary. What does the problem sound like to you?"

"Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help.

"Hello. From the brief history you have given, it seems like there is not much to worry about. First of all, I need to know some more detailed points. Where exactly in the wrist the shot was given? I mean is it the extensors of the thumb (de quervain) or is it for any other finger? Also, do you have thyroid issues? Sometimes when the large volume of fluid is injected into the tendon sheath and surrounding area, due to distension it can cause severe pain and patients do complain of exaggerated symptoms prior to injection. Small vessels must have been punctured (quite normal) which lead to extravasation of blood hence the bruise. It will take a few more days, but both the bruise and the bump should go away. Do apply ice packs there you will get you the necessary relief. Ganglion cysts are notorious for recurrence but highly unlikely to be associated or related to the injection. If you can send me a clinical picture that would be better. Splint is fine but you do need to mobilize your wrist for a very long time otherwise you might end up having stiff wrist (2-3 weeks should not cause any stiffness). Understanding tendinitis is important you need a very specific rehab protocol and few medications and you should feel much better in few weeks time. Did you get your vitamin D levels tested? Kindly revert with the info.  ","Hello doctor, I am a 24-year-old female. I received a second round of a cortisone shot in my wrist on 18th May for wrist tendinitis. During the injection, it hurt much worse than the first shot. I have been told to keep my wrist in a splint at all times. My wrist is still bruised where the injection was given. There is now a bump as well where I have injected hurts when touched. Before the first shot, I had a ganglion on my wrist that popped. I cannot say for certain if the bump is from the injection or the ganglion is back because of the shot. I need to know if this is normal or if I should go to a clinic over the weekend?

"Hello, Welcome you to icliniq.com. I can understand you must be very concerned about your father's health. Well I have reviewed his medical history, which he has been taking for hypertension, prostate, and recent use of antibiotics and Imodium. So typical symptom you mention that whenever he urges to pass urine, stools passes by itself which is suggestive of stool incontinence-means loss of control stools. With his age, it is possible that he has weak anal sphincter. The anal sphincter is a muscle around the anus which contracts and control the stool output. In older age, it become weak and lack sustained contraction hence get loosened. With every attempt to pass urine, which increases abdominal pressure, would also lead to evacuation of stools. This stool incontinence because of loose sphincter at times perceived as diarrhea, however, it is not actual diarrhea. For diarrhea, once has to have stool volume more than 200 ml/24 hour, and significant change in consistency of stools like watery stools, or greenish unformed stools containing food particles. If none of these signs which are suggestive of diarrhea I suggest you to stop Ofloxacin if given for perceived diarrhea. The drug he has been taking for prostate also causes external anal sphincter and hence partly contribute to his stool incontinence. I want to know if he is feeling mucus (thick jelly like material) in stools, blood in stools or rectal pain, or repeated visits to toilet when nothing comes out? This information is important to rule out any inflammatory process beside loose anal sphincter. I suggest you few investigation for stool studies, which will tell if he has active infection of bowel and if present can be treated with antibiotics then. For treatment he can take Imodium, two tablets thrice daily for two more days. Excessive use of this medication would cause constipation and can worsen patient discomfort. I want you to help him learn pelvic muscle strengthening exercises. There are many youtube videos available to learn how to do pelvic floor strengthening exercises while sitting on a common chair. Lastly biofeedback therapy which is a computerized software which help him to control his anal sphincter while passing urine or otherwise. This treatment is offered at physiotherapy department of a hospital. Avoid excessive fibers and modify liquids (1 to 1.5 liter maximum) intake in a day. This would reduce the overall bulk of stools formation in the bowel and hence decreased stool output. Stop or reduce alcohol intake if taking. This also causes diarrhea and loose sphincter controls. I hope this helps. Stool incontinence secondary to age with loose sphincter, plus drug side effect. Digital rectal examination (performed by gastroenterologist in person). Norectal manometry (not usually required if digital rectal examination is suggestive of the diagnosis). Stool detail report. Stool fecal calprotecin and  stool for occult blood. Stool for ova and parasites. Stool for fat globules and reducing substance. Complete blood count. Stool incontinence secondary to older age and drug-related.

"Hi. Following is my opinion for your asked question. HIV tri dot antibody test is having good sensitivity and specificity in ruling out HIV as like that of fourth generation ELISA. Usually tri dot HIV test is able to rule out HIV after six weeks of exposure. However, HIV test can be considered conclusive in ruling out HIV after three month of exposure. So, I suggest you investigate with HIV rapid test after 12 week again. You can revert back with HIV report after 12 week of exposure to check it.

"Hi. Most common reason for bleeding from the ear is due to trauma. There is nothing that you need to worry about as this is extremely common. Make sure you do not use earbuds as they often traumatize the ear canal or eardrum and introduce infections. Please do not use headphones or earphones as well, until it heals. Make sure you keep the ear dry, make sure no water enters the ear at any cost. For now you can apply Ciplox (Ciprofloxacin) ear drops three drops thrice a day and take tablet LCZ (Levocetirizine) 10 mg one tablet at night after meals for the next one week (this will reduce any itching). Make sure that there is no pus like discharge from the ear because in such a situation, the infection of the eardrum is more likely and will require systemic oral antibiotics. I hope this helps.

"Hi. Reviewing your history and pictures showed (attachment removed to protect patient identity), there might be skin irritation which can be from repeated frictions like masturbation or reaction to the substance used it also can be due to vitamin deficiency or a skin condition like psoriasis, etc. Fungal infection is rare and it does not present as a spot usually it is whitish material and happens in people who are immune compromised like diabetics or people who have HIV infections. Since it is not itchy or painful you should not worry about it and you should not use Cortisone cream as it makes things worse. Keep good hygiene area should be dry and clean. Use nonchemical lubricant like olive oil if you masturbate. If you have changed your soap or shower gel it might be the cause. Take vitamin E and vitamin A to replace your vitamin deficiency. If you are known to have psoriasis then treatment can be by Methoteraxate cream (but only for people who are known to have psoriasis).

"Hello. I have gone through the results you attached (attachment removed to protect patient identity). You are experiencing missed beats aslo known as premature ventricular contractions. They are are usually benign (harmless). Your symptoms can be worsened by drinking, caffeine, smoking or some medications. I usually do not prescribe my patients medication at first except it affects your daily activity. Firstly, avoid trigerrs like alcohol, drugs, sleeplessness, etc. Try to exercise regularly. Atleast 3 or 4 times a week. For a duration of 30 minutes. Make sure to sleep 6 to 7 hours daily at night. If your symptoms persist, you will need a Beta-Blocker medication. It acts by regulating how your heart beats. Ablation is the definite treatment of choice if all measures fail but am hopeful it will not get to that. I wish you good health. Best regards.

I can feel this in my stomach/chest area and feels like a heavy beat or a missed beat. I will upload a couple of PDF results to show you. You can quite clearly see when these large beats take place. I sometimes get chest pain but I usually attribute this to my stomach or anxiety, and the chest pain does not tend to accompany the heart palpitation. My main worry is it is quite regularly happening and it is one singular beat which is ‘off’. I have bad bloating which has been for the last month or two which comes and goes, but am unsure if this is related."
"Hello. As a human we all carry some kinds of secrets or fear back in our head. I felt glad as you have the courage to admit that, most people cannot. So be proud of that. I think you need a scaling too, as you have not brushed for a long time its leads to swollen gingiva that might be the reason of uncomfortable using a brush. As you have caries and sensitivity associated, you might not necessarily need an extraction. If the caries has progressed alot, root canal can be done to save your tooth. Betadine Mouthwash, Gargle in lukewarm water 2-3 times a day. Do not worry, use it, if any foul breath that will be covered and your secret will be safe. As you feel uncomfortable using a brush, you can brush using your finger and toothpaste. That way your mouth will also be clean and issue with bristle will also be resolved. You can also take capsule Sporidex 500 mg one apsule BD for 5 days, tablet Zerodol SP 1 tablet BD for 5 days, capsule Pan D one capsule BD before meal for 5 days. You will be needing a scaling to remove any tartar. Once done you can start practising brushing using a soft bristle brush (even a baby brush will do for a start). I am confident you will succeed. But you have to start the habit and you will get used to it, trust me. You can train and motivate yourself by rewarding a candy or anything special. By that way you can overcome your fear and gain comfidence. I am glad that I could be someone whom you can share a secret. I wish you good luck. You can trust me and ask if any further query. I will be happy to help further. Hope your treatment goes fine. Do as I asked you to do. You are brave, you will be fine. I am confident about that.  ","Hello doctor, I am going to the dentist soon and I know I have a cavity and I think it is pretty big- it is easily noticeable. And I am just nervous because it is probably obvious that I do not brush- the bristles are always a really weird texture for me and I just do not want anyone to be mad at me because I have known about it for a while now (I feel bad for saying this, but I think it has been around six months) and never mentioned it to anyone because I am little scared of going to the dentist. I do not like anyone feeling around in my mouth and knowing about this cavity is making me even more nervous for going there today. I have had teeth pulled in the past and I hate everything about it, but I am not sure they could just fill in this cavity."
"Hello. Do not worry about the periods, as you are aware that delay in periods can be due to obesity as you had suffered last time, however my compliments to you for reducing 14 kg of weight (attachment removed to protect patient identity), so we can conclude that delay is not due to being overweight. Then delay can be due to hormonal changes due to various medications specially birth control pills, etc., which you are not taking. Stress is also one of the major reasons these days due to Corona and associated problems. Pregnancy can be a reason but only if one is sexually active, and you are out of that risk as well. May be the cramps you had are signs of periods onset, we can wait for 2-3 days and may be then start with medication.

"Hello.  First, let me appreciate you for describing whatever your child has appropriately. As you have said that the baby has just started walking about 5 months ago, the problem with balance could be just his learning curve. Kids normally do fall while learning to walk, am sure even you will be aware of that. He is able to walk, rule and climb stairs only means he is growing normally.  Now, to say if the balancing issue is normal or not you can make a small video of it and show me. It is difficult to say without seeing the baby. Let us assume that it is a part of normal development, then you do not have to go to a doctor and you do not have to worry about it. Now, if we assume that it could be because of a physical problem, the child will have to be examined. My advise is to wait till he completes 2 years. If the problem still persists, then you have to go to a doctor.  ","Hello doctor,  Age of the child: 20 Months  Gender: Male  Weight: 12 Kilograms  Height: 30 inches  Started Walking: 15 Months  Started Sitting: 5 months  Started Crawling: 12 months  Problem:  My baby has started walking at the age of 15 months and is very active. He runs, jumps, rolls, and can climb stairs with the help of an adult. And can speak 2 words sentences. The problem we are facing is a balance issue. He is an active child but has an issue in maintaining good posture and is easy to fall. When standing straight and static an observer can feel that he is dizzy and swings slightly left and right to maintain the balance. He also has lazy neck control. At 2 months of age he suffered from “Torticollis” which we have managed to minimize by exercises recommended by other pediatrics. He also has digestion problems since birth and has loose motion after 1 week. He has also slight drooling. My question: Is this balance probelm common in this age group or should we choose to consult an in-person doctor which I am avoiding due to COVID-19 crisis as the hospitals are crowded."
"Hi. I treat a lot of singers, so I totally understand what you are going through. To answer your first question, yes it is totally possible to diagnose based on an audio clip of you singing (attachment removed to protect patient identity), though a better method would be a scopy of your voice box. However, I am guessing there are breaks or voice gaps in certain parts when you hit a high note. This is common among male singers. The issue here is that your voice box has 2 vocal cords that vibrate when you sing. The slightest inflammation or irregularity in these vocal cords can produce noticeable changes in a singers voice. The problem here is that the slightest change in the singing voice makes the singer more anxious and he tends to practice harder. Doctors typically prescribe steroids, but that will not help unless you give your voice a rest. Give the vocal cords enough time to heal. There is a lot more I would like to say, but I will try and summarize my advice for you.  1. Total voice rest for 7 days. No speaking, no whispering.  2. Daily concentrated salt water gargles.  3. Steroids (Betnesol) 0.5 mg 2 times a day for 5 days.  4. Pantoprazole 40 every morning for 7 days.  5. After 7 days, try afresh and record the audio, I would love to hear the before and after.  Hope you become a star singer one day.  ","Hello doctor, I am a singer, but in recent times, I have not been able to sing high pitch. I develop pain in my throat while singing high notes.

"Hello. I suggest you to take once a day pill for controlling your acid reflux. Capsule Esomeprazole 40 mg half an hour before meals.

"Hi. I have had a look at the pictures you have sent (attachment removed to protect patient identity). The tonsils are definitely enlarged in this case, there is no doubt about it. The tonsils have a very rich blood supply and are relatively avascular structure. It is normal to encounter leash of blood vessels over the tonsil or its adjacent areas like the anterior and posterior pillars (these are two walls in between which the tonsils reside). Unless and until the tonsils are inflamed and the child is symptomatic, we do not need to give any sort of antibiotics as it is not indicated. At the same point of time, enlarged tonsil indicates possible previous episodes of recurrent tonsillitis as a result of which the tonsillar tissues get hypertrophied and attains a larger size. It is always better to maintain strict oral hygiene, do saltwater gargles five to six times a day at regular intervals. Avoid anything cold, spicy, and oily food/beverages. Maintaining precautionary measures definitely goes a long way in preventing recurrent sore throats or streptococcal infections. However, in a situation where the child is having recurrent sore throats with associated fever, significant leaves from school, it is always better to get the tonsils removed. There are criteria given by aao-hns (American association of otorhinolaryngologists and head and neck surgeons) who have laid down criteria for a patient to undergo tonsillectomy. In nutshell, visible blood vessels over the tonsils or related adjacent structures is not a worry as it is very common and seen in health and have not pathology related to it. Sticking of the uvula to the right tonsil is due to surface tension of the saliva and enlarged size of the tonsil. This again has no clinical significance. There is absolutely nothing that you need to worry or get stressed about. Make sure you advise the child to follow the instructions that I have given above to prevent recurrent sore throats. In addition, she can also use crushed ginger with manuka honey (you can add crushed ginger and honey in a cup and give it together one tablespoon three times a day). Honey has excellent antioxidant, antiviral, antibacterial properties and so does ginger. I hope this helps.  ","Hello doctor, We noticed our 6-year-old daughter has a visible blood vessel on one of her tonsils. She feels fine and says her throat feels fine. Is this a cause of concern? We have never noticed it before? It has been three months since she was at the dentist and I know they check her tonsils. This is very weird, please advise if this is very serious."
"Hello. Since when are you suffering from this condition? It may be reactive arthritis (Reiter's syndrome) in which urethritis or UTI (urinary tract infection) followed by joint swelling and rash. It may be associated with dry mouth and dry eyes. It may be a different entity like groin rash which may be a fungal infection. Joint swelling may be due to arthritis or gout or crystal-induced inflammation. Left axillary pain may be due to herpes zoster or boils or shoulder joint arthritis or rotator cuff problem or hypothyroidism. Until examination is done it is difficult to say what it is. Get it done urine culture and sensitivity, CRP (C-reactive protein), ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate), and x-ray of left ankle joint. Use tablet Naproxen 250 mg twice a day for five days. Keep limb on elevation mode while sleeping. Please review with reports or consult with your physician he will examine and treat you accordingly.

"Hello. Well, you did not share your body weight? Do you feel any symptoms like fatigue, weakness, or loss of energy? This information is important because only SGPT which is just nearly one and a half times raised cannot tell a diagnosis on its own. To answer your concern that it is harmful? yes it is, but whether it is less harmful or highly harmful, that depends upon the underlying condition. The causes of such raised SGPT are many folds.

"Hello. I can imagine you must be very upset about your sister. And I really feel sorry that she is in pain for a week's time. Well, the pain you mention that is severe and radiating to back is suggestive of pancreatitis. However, the possibility of peptic ulcers cannot be completely ruled out. Ideally, the pancreatitis that is inflammation of the pancreas (a gland at the back of tummy) should be managed in the hospital. However, the pain of ulcers (peptic ulcers) in the stomach and small bowel can be managed at home. But before making a diagnosis it is required that you provide further history about her pain. Did she have this before? And if yes, how long it last? Did she frequently have heartburn or acidity issues? Is she on some medications right now? You mentioned her age, what is her marital status? Did she have fever? or yellowish eyes? or dark yellow eyes? You mention she has yellowish vomiting, but is she able to take orally or she is throwing up everything like water or food that you give to her? You see all this information can help us to decide the most probable cause of the underlying pain and consider some treatment to see the response. For time being, you can give her capsule Esomeprazole 4o mg now and half hour before meals. Expect the reduction in pain if it is due to peptic ulcer disease. The pain of pancreatitis will not settle with this capsule. If she is unable to take orally, then you can visit a nearby nursing clinic and get IV Omeprazole 40 mg. Pancreatitis.

"Hello. A ringing sound or wind-like sound in the ear lasting for more than five minutes is called tinnitus. If less than five minutes, it is not significant. This particular sound you are describing can be caused due to dysfunctional eustachian tube, i.e. the tube connecting the ear and the nose. Usually, it is more in quiet environments and more noticeable when you are attempting to fall asleep. Crowded and noisy places serve as a distraction and do not let you notice the sound. Medicines do work, but it takes at least a month for them to act, that too the sound does not vanish until two to three months have gone by. I understand the trouble it is causing you. So what is to be done? 1. Keep a table fan for white noise when you are trying to fall asleep. 2. Try and distract yourself when you hear the sound. 3. Get a hearing test done. You can use an audiometry app and send me the result. 4. Follow the prescription. Saline nasal drops and steam inhalation three times a day for seven days. Fluticasone nasal spray two times a day for seven days.  ","Hello doctor, I have been hearing a wind like rhythmic noise in my right ear. It also makes my ears feel full.

"Hi. I will give you a few food lists and guidelines to incorporate in your daily diet schedule. Include iron rich foods. If you are non-vegetarian then you can also include egg yolk, chicken liver, fish along with other veg foods. If you are a vegetarian then you can include soybean, sprouts, garden cress seeds, oats, couscous, broken wheat, pomegranate, apple, banana, green leafy vegetables. Squeeze lemon on your veggies, meat, and salad as vitamin C helps in absorption of iron. You can also take fresh lime juice or orange juice with your meals. Avoid taking any caffeine with or immediately after meals, caffeine hinder iron absorption. You can cook your meals on iron tawa or iron pots. Also avoid taking calcium and iron together, as calcium also hinders in iron absorption. For example, if you are taking calcium and iron supplements, do not take it together, keep duration in between two supplementations. I hope this helps.

"Hello. No, it is not an indication of DVT (deep vein thrombosis). The earliest symptom of DVT would be swelling, which is usually unilateral associated with pain. Rash may occur but in later stages and associated with swelling/pain, which may occur due to venous congestion.

Do you have any systemic disease which could explain these symptoms? Regarding possible causes, these are inflammatory skin rashes, which may be due to due to allergies, insect bites, viral infections, skin irritation due to clothes and more likely possibility is of drug-induced as you are on medications like Aspirin, etc. So try to correlate with the above-mentioned factors.

"Hello. I had gone through all the details posted. The difference in size of the testicles is mainly because of two reasons, orchitis and hydrocele. Orchitis is inflammation of the testicles, which has happened three years back due to mumps. There will be redness, pain and no fluid around the testis. For decrease of swelling and pain, we need to use anti-inflammatory agents. If there is any bacterial infection, then we need to use antibiotics. In case of hydrocele, if the inflammation is more, then the fluid will be formed around the testis, which needs ultrasound and clinical examination for diagnosis. If there is fluid around the testis, then it can be removed by surgery. If you have hydrocele, there is chance for rejection to foreign countries. So, you may need to be operated. If it is only different size of the testis and no fluid, then there may not be a chance for rejection. So, you need to consult a general surgeon and get an ultrasound of the scrotum for further management.

"Hi. The medicine your doctor has prescribed is good. Take tablet Pause 500 mg (Tranexamic acid and Mefenamic acid) thrice a day for five days. I hope your doctor also did a vaginal examination and had a look at your cervix to see for any lesion. Though mostly hormonal it may sometimes be due to cervical disease or cancer. If she has not done a vaginal examination I suggest you go to it. Also, recheck your thyroid levels to see if any dose change is needed. Go for an ultrasound seven days prior to your next expected period. It is called a premenstrual ultrasound pelvis. Test for FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone) and LH (Lutenizing hormone) too on day two of your next periods. Consult again with reports.  ","Hello doctor, I am a 42-year-old female.

"Hi! Covid has been somewhat a new entity and thereby we have been seeing its effects in detail on the human system. Loss of smell or anosmia has been one of the peculiar atypical features of covid and there have been lots of theories and explanations behind it. In all circumstances, loss of smell and taste are always associated together irrespective of the cause. This is attributed to the close approximaty of both the processing centres in the brain. It usually takes around 1 to 6 months to regain the perception of smell in covid patients. There are a lot of aspects that we need to study on regarding ethnicity and its relation to the covid, prognosis etc which will take time as its not an easy process. There is nothing that you need to worry about, make sure you dont have any underlying allergic issues in addition. For now you can enrich your diet with loads od fruits and vegetables. I dont recommend any drug without any scientific evidence of it being useful for the condition mentioned above. I hope i have answered your query.

"Hello. I welcome you to icliniq. I can imagine that you must be very concerned about ongoing pus. Well yes there is some pus, but the large part of the wound is healthy and pink. It is not uncommon to have pus few days after the surgery. The treatment you are taking are rightly prescribed, but I did not know the dose of amoxicillin which is a antibiotic. If you are taking under dose, I suggest you to take 1 gm twice daily (total of 2000 mg daily). You can simply take a guaze peice and wipe down the pus which is coming. It is highly possible that this pus will dry in coming few days. You can add Tab metronidazole 400 mg thrice daily for 7 days to help heal the infection. I also want to know do you have any other abdominal symptoms? such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, or unusual weight loss? because it is important to know whether you have other problem within the bowel which is manifesting as anal fistula.

"Hello. How did you get this? Because of the bleeding, the depth of the wound could not be perceived. If it is not severe enough just with bleeding there is not much problem. Just the point of worry is that the wound should not be open or otherwise it may be problematic and may require suturing. So you should seek emergency advice as well so that somebody can examine it. Until then use Moxitobra (Moxifloxacin) eye drop two hours one drop in the right eye only. Refresh tears 0.5% eye drops QID one drop in the right eye only. Avoid any kind of undue pressure.

"Hi. Yes, insulin might result in some weight gain, but if you are keeping a check on your calories and include a good amount of non-starchy food including whole grain, fresh whole fruits, and vegetables will help you to shed some fat. Keep a check on your exercise minutes, you can easily do 150 minutes of aerobic exercise per week which includes walking, bicycling, and other forms of moderate muscle strengthening exercises. Just keep in mind that your sugar level must not go down, do not reduce your insulin dosage. Also never skip a meal, if you skip a meal you will tend to indulge more calories in the next meal. Include more protein rich food, protein, and fiber rich meals will bring early satiety and will easily help build in more muscles than fat. I hope this helps.  ","Hello doctor, I am a type 1 diabetic and have been injecting insulin every day for years already. With this current quarantine going on, I gained some weight which made me worry. Although my BMI says that I am on the normal side, it still made me upset because the belly, arms, and legs have gotten bigger. So I started doing minimal resistance training and changed my eating habits for three weeks already. I noticed that my legs look leaner but my upper body is still the same. This made me anxious because it might have something to do with my insulin medications and I cannot go to an actual dietician since they were still on quarantine so I thought someone might be able to help me online. I am hoping to hear from you. This would really be a big help to my overall health for the rest of my life."

"Hi, Welocme to icliniq.com.  First of all, we need to understand that this not something which is is unusual. We all come across with past experiences and associate with them on certain occasions. If those past experiences were pleasurable one that there is innate wish to re-experience them and same is applicable for you. It can be said that this is normal to have fantasy to love and loved by someone who was very close to you. However, we need to keep track of society and changes that took place over the last four years.

In case you push her in some different way that too create problems for her as well as you. At this stage it is important to do following.  1. Minimise the interaction with her through common friends and relatives. If possible avoid meeting her completely.  2. Engage yourself with productive work. Do not allow your brain to wander here and there.  3. Get married or in relationship if still single. This is most important part as other romantic relationship will distract you to the core needs of life and will also allow you to understand her situation.  4. Acknowledge that this is common emotion and you will try your level best to overcome it.  5. Discuss with your best friends about the situation and moral dilemmas, if possible.

"Hello. Your ECG is fine and sinus arrhythmia is normal phenomenon, where heart range varies with respiration. It may not be evident always or depends on sensitivity of machine, and also it is more pronounced, detectable when one is breathing heavily or rapidly. So it is not a matter of worry at all.  Next thing, were you also having palpitations when ECG was taken or subsided by that time? Because considering symptoms of palpitations and chest discomfort, its important to rule out possibility of cardiac arrhythmias like PSVT/ paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, which are intermittent and ECG would be absolutely normal at other time. So normal ECG does not rule out possibility of arrhythmia.  So you should either have holter monitoring (24 hour ECG monitoring, but it would detect arrhythmia only if it happened during this 24 hour period) or you can buy simple single lead ECG devices, which would help to monitor your rhythm whenever you are symptomatic. So, basically we need an ECG rhythm during symptoms so as to reliably rule out possibility of cardiac arrhythmia. In a nutshell, your ECG is fine and may need further steps. I would also like to know why are you eliquis, Prednisone. And thyroid problems may cause arrhythmia like atrial fibrillation, so TSH should be monitored.   ","Hello doctor, I went to urgent care today because I had bad heart palpitations while taking a walk, along with some cuest discomfort.

"Hello.  What are your symptoms? What was your dietary intake in 1-2 days prior to test? Amy family history of major gastrointestinal diseases?

Also, lysozyme is slightly elevated and it is a marker of inflammation in bowel which may be due to multiple reasons like IBS, IBD or diarrhea, etc. So it' is a nonspecific marker.   But important factor is stool for occult blood, which is positive. So there is some minor bleeding is going on within a bowels. This is the abnormality which should be evaluated further. This has multiple causes ranging from IBD to polyps, etc. However, some dietary factors like some fruits, vitamin C, iron supplements, nasal bleeding, hemorrhoids, etc, can give positive results.  Now, we would like to get total of 3 samples for occult blood testing and if it remains positive subsequently then needs endoscopy, or even if having symptoms then still need endoscopy. So, the concerning factor is stool for occult blood, rather than rest three, and needs further evaluation.

"Hi. Looking into your problem it seems you are badly in pain and looking for things can help you walk so you remember about crutches. As simple protocols use simple formula RICE rest, ice compression and elevation of your feet are key sutra.  For severe sprains, you might need a brace for protection and stability its good to use ankle brace having binder together in it. You may need crutches until you can walk without pain. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can help to control pain and swelling. We need to evaluate ankle with Grade II or Grade III sprains. Grade III sprains with complete tears of the ligaments even might need surgery to repair the injured ligaments. One thing to remember is that always in most cases, follow-up rehabilitative exercises are to restore strength and range of motion in the sprained ankle-also help to prevent future ankle injuries. If it is not healed ,think of doing X-ray of ankle, you might not know sometime there can be hairline fracture too (stress fracture).

"Hello. Following is my opinion for your asked question. Your total WBC count and neutrophils are high. Mild increase of immature granulocytes and high count with neutrophilia could be due to infection or inflammation in the body. Your detailed physical examination and investigation should be done to find the underlying cause. For your complaint you can investigate further with ANA (antinuclear antibody) estimation, USG (ultrasound) abdomen, Vitamin D estimation, serum calcium estimation, blood pressure measurement, and blood sugar estimation. Your ear examination also should be done. Antibiotic courses can be prescribed as per the provided report. However, before that physical examination and above investigation can be done. You need to follow up your CBC (complete blood count) with peripheral smear examination report after a few days to check values once again. You can consult a good internal medicine specialist for your examination and investigation accordingly.

"Hello. I can imagine your reason of concern for such ongoing on and off symptoms. Well first of all, if it were ulcerative or Crohn's disease it should have shown something abnormal on CT scan which I presume it did not. However, remember the CT scan reporting is completely a subjective thing. It depends highly on the expertise of radiologists who has reported that. I would urge if you upload the report in reply to this response, I would be glad to see that. There will be no charges for that I will allow you one free follow up. Now the presence of too many stools is not an uncommon finding on CT Scan. Since it is basically the function of the colon to reserve stools transit them timely in anterograde direction and finally to be evacuated through the rectum and anal canal. If the presence of stool with dilation of the lumen of colon or presence of stools within small bowel (fecalization of small bowel) and/or dilation of the lumen of small bowel suggest an alarming finding. Normally our small bowel does not usually contain stools, it rapidly empties matter to in to large bowel, hence the presence of stool in small bowel suggests an abnormal finding. I will tell you why this information on CT scan is important. For example, you have a normal size of the lumen of bowel (ideally less than 3 cm of small bowel and less than 5 cm of large bowel) with the symptoms you mention, it can be irritable bowel syndrome with constipation. If the diameter of the lumen is above the normal it can be functional constipation of which two further types. The one is chronic colonic constipation or colonic pseudo-obstruction called as Ogilvie's syndrome. The other where the small bowel is dilated called chronic small bowel pseudo obstruction. I hope you now have an idea why it is important to correlate symptoms with the CT scan findings. Now coming to your symptoms, the pain or discomfort is often common when bowel loops are distended with gas or stools and your discomfort which readily resolves after you have good bowel movements suggest the possibility of the same and not otherwise due to a serious underlying cause. The intensity of discomfort that changes with the bowel movement again suggests it might secondary to irritable bowel syndrome IBS. Metamucil is fiber laxative and really it does not have any harm if taken for years and years. The fiber is nonabsorbale molecule it does not go into blood circulation so have no side effects. However, in some it can cause bloating or belching. You can switch to other fibers such as Fibrocol if Metamucil does not suit you. Otherwise, it is completely normal if you want to resume the same. Take plenty of water it makes stool bulk large and soft and easy to pass. I myself have a habit of taking 3 liters of water in a day and this really makes wonder. You should continue that. I would wait for your CT scan report to see the findings then I will right you some investigations to rule out other possibilities. I believe you would not have anyone but just to be on the safe side.  ","Hi doctor, I have been having abdominal discomfort for a while. At first, the discomfort was in the flank portion. I went to a urologist he gave me muscle relaxers and a few tablets for clearing any small stones. The discomfort went away after taking the medication. But after some days may be due to sex or workout am not sure, the discomfort returned back. I went to the doctor again he suggested a CT scan. CT scan results showed a lot of stools in the bowel. He said to maintain a healthy diet and add more water and fiber and do some exercises if the problem persists he asked to check with the general practitioner. I had an appointment with my family physician who said the discomfort can be due to lack of bowel movements in the colon. He asked me to take a fiber supplement (Metamucil) after taking it I had clean bowel movements and I felt I was relieved. Of late, I stopped taking the fiber supplement for a couple of days I started having hard stools. Again I called up the doctor, he said no harm in taking Metamucil. So I started it again and drinking at least three liters of water. I am doing like he said to have clean bowel movements. Sometimes the discomfort switches sides left or right. At times my backache as well. I told the doctor and he said it can be chronic constipation can go for many days. I sense my stomach or colon may getting inflamed as the day goes by. After bath everything looks normal. But as day goes by I feel like stiffness or inflammation in the stomach. I am worried because this is been there for like starting January and not going away. There is no real pain but it is the discomfort and inflammation that disrupts my day to day activities. Please advise. Should I book an appointment with gastroenterologist may be to dig further? I read about ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease, but I could not conclude anything based on symptoms. I do have an observation that if I masturbate or have sex, after having ejaculation discomfort increases the following day."

I get my period every month and I have lost weight with the Metformin. I went in for a follow up today and my doctor recommended that I sign up for an infertility study that she is doing.

Since it is extensive it is important to start proper treatment with oral antifungals for a good length of time to clear the infection.

You should get your LFT and KFT done and you can follow up with dermatologist.

"Hi! Welcome to icliniq & thanks for the query. Recurrent boils can be a nuisance. It is a bacterial infection of the hair follicle and can cause painful pus filled eruptions on the body. If you are having frequent recurrences it could be because of persistent infection or reinfection. Are you diabetic or atopic? If so, you may be more prone to develop recurrent bacterial infections. You mention seeing pus coming from many openings which indicates it could be a carbuncle. This may need incision & drainage. Ideally a pus culture should be done to know the sensitivity of the organism and antibiotics started accordingly to completely treat the infection. Usually penicillins, cephalosporins or tetracyclines are used orally. Application of mupirocin in the skin fold areas helps to eradicate the colonising bacteria in these locations. Some precautions to prevent recurrent boils include: Hope this helps  ","I have had boils appear from time to time. The come to a head , break and drain.

"Hello. Neural tube defects (NTD) in the baby mostly occur in women deficient in Folic acid, or who are diabetic, or if they have any family history or as an associated defect with other chromosomal anomalies. Yes, the baby's organs do develop in the early weeks of pregnancy, and any extreme exposures can pose risk for maternal health and also for fetal development. But I have never come across the risk of developing NTD with exposure to sauna. But anyway it would be better if you avoid it for the future. As of now you need not worry too much about this exposure, stay calm and stay positive. The first-trimester scanning at 12 weeks is good enough to pick any NTDs and I do not think that would be too late, or you need to go for any termination of pregnancy just because of the exposure to sauna. At this early pregnancy, there is no means to find out if the baby has developed any abnormalities or not. And also the second TM scan detailed anatomical scan at 18-20 weeks can also pick most (90-95%) of any structural anomalies. Also regarding your gestational age calculations, if your cycles were always regular, then you should calculate the weeks from the starting day of your last menstrual period. It would have been really helpful if you had mentioned the same, it would have helped me correlate if your assumption of weeks of pregnancy are correct or not. I am assuming, as you said you are in the fifth week now, so you just skipped your periods a few days back. Tablet Folic Acid 5 mg daily once after food. Avoid sexual intercourse for the first three months of pregnancy.  ","Hi doctor, I just found out that I am pregnant (5th week).

The whole point of the sauna is to detox, and I definitely was overheating (sweating and red-faced). I did however take two breaks where I jumped in cold water to cool down. Anyways, I read that overheating when pregnant can cause horrible neural tube damage that can lead to birth defects especially in these crucial early weeks when it is forming. My question is how worried should I be? Should I go to a specialist for this? Is it so bad that I should consider termination? My first scan is at 12 weeks and that is the only time I will be able to ask anything and I will be worried it is too late."

"Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception.

"Hello. Congratulations on your wedding. First thing you should do is to start Folic acid and try for timed intercourse. For that, if your periods are regular you can download an application of period tracking. It will tell you the most fertile days of your cycle. Since you are 44 where ovarian reserve may be on a lower side I will not advise you to waste much time. So while you try for a month or two for natural methods of conception I want you to also get tested in the meantime so that you are ready for any medical intervention for fertility enhancing if needed after two months. So please go for LH (leutinizing hormone), FSH (follicle stimulating hormone), AMH (anti-Mullerian hormone) and TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) blood levels. Also get an OGTT (oral glucose tolerance test) and ultrasound pelvis. Your partner can also go for semen analysis to see if the quality of his sperm is good enough. Eat healthily, sleep well and ask your partner also to avoid smoking and alcohol.  ","Hello doctor, I have just got married and I am planning to have a child.

"Hello. Her foot appears to be in good condition now (attachment removed to protect patient identity). The likely cause for bluish discoloration is blockages only and is called peripheral arterial disease. So of she should be treated on the line of blockages itself. Now blockages in the foot raise the strong possibility of blockages elsewhere in the body like heart, brain, and its fortunate that she did not suffer any consequences due to that. So she should be evaluated with few investigations, like ECG (echocardiogram), Echo, Fasting lipid profile (sugar if not done recently). Also, to confirm the diagnosis, she should undergo CT (computed tomography) angiography of both the lower limbs. Now coming to the treatment part, obviously, the best would be to open it with stents. But as of now, she will need some more medications than what she is having. You may continue with Neurowin or better to have it in a tablet form once daily, and it is just a multivitamin supplement. She should also continue plain Ecospirin and dose should be 75 mg only at bedtime. Now in my opinion, she should additionally have tablet Rosuvastatin 10 mg bedtime once daily and tablet Cilostazol 50 mg twice daily after food. She should also have some antacids along with these medications like tablet Cyra 20 mg (Rabeprazole) once daily before breakfast. So these three medications should be added additionally until her evaluation is completed and probably will need to continue for the long term. Zerodol SP should be avoided as it may harm her by causing bleeding or raising blood pressure. Plain paracetamol is allowed. She should be encouraged to move and walk atleast 30 minutes a day as it would improve blood flow. I hope this helps.  ","Hello doctor, Patient is an 82-year-old female. She weighs only about 45 kg.

"Hello. First of all, I like to inform you that PCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome) could be an underlying cause for vaginal dryness due to hormonal imbalance caused by PCOS itself. Secondly, itching is probably the result of vaginal dryness rather than anything else. In case you are sexually active, we need to look for STI (sexually transmitted infection) as they can also present with similar symptoms. Practically speaking if the vaginal dryness causing significant impairment in your quality of life, it is time to see a doctor. She may run some tests and do some examination to find out the exact cause of the problem. However, for time being topical estrogen can be used for symptomatic relief. It is available in the form of gel, ring or cream. As per your convenience, you can use either cream or gel and the use of ring requires assistance of a doctor. The second thing is stress management. Stress is one of the common reasons for causing decreased vaginal lubrication. Thirdly, avoid soap-based formulations to clean the private area as it increases dryness. I hope this helps.

"Hello. Could you attach picture of it? Are those painful? Are you sexually active or do have close contacts with other individuals or do you share any clothes? If those are multiple small vesicles aligned or grouped together, with clear fluid inside rather than pus, then those are likely a herpes infection. Then you would antiviral like Acyclovir or Valacyclovir. Now since it is less than 72 hours, it is better to get antiviral prescribed, which gives better result with early treatment. Herpes is usually painful to begin with or may get painful later. If there is single swollen area with clear pus demonstrable or there is drainage then it is a bacterial infection which would need antibiotics like Augmentin.

"Hello. I will definitely help you regarding your query. Skin tags are formed in long standing anal fissure. These are nothing but accumulated skin due to fissure. Usually nothing to do that but if you do not like them, you can opt for surgery. It is a very minor surgery. No side effects or any problem after removing them by experienced hands. A raw area will form that will heal by its own. It can reappear if you have another formation of anal fissure. So avoid the conditions that will cause it again. So do not worry just go through the surgery if you do not want them.  ","Hello doctor, I have two small anal skin tags developed from healed fissures. Physically they do not bother me much but mentally I do not like to have them.

He also said skin tags might grow back in future as skin looses as you age. Is there any side effects of the surgery or should I go ahead with surgery? Do the skin tags reappear after surgery?"
"Hello, Welcome to cliniq.com. I see you have taken all the necessary medications for the fissure in anus. What I would like to tell you is you need to do two more important things. Firstly, since you have fissure and piles I can guess you might have constipation quite commonly hence you must be straining to pass the stools so I suggest you stop straining while passing stools. Next, add fiber to your diet. Consuming one cucumber and carrot a day will help you a lot to avoid constipation. Also, drink plenty of water throughout the day. Secondly, how you use the medication is also important. I advise you to do a sitz bath twice a day (add Betadine 5 ml in lukewarm water in a tub and sit on it for 5 to 10 minutes). Next apply the Lox-2% (Lignocaine hydrochloride) cream (opaque) and not gel, as gel does not get absorbed and the cream crosses the skin. Apply it before passing stools and immediately after cleaning yourself after passing the stools. You can apply it whenever you have severe pain also. You can also take syrup Lactulose 15 ml at night time after food for 10 days. For the piles, if you have third or fourth-degree piles then surgery is the only choice. For first and second degrees you can treat by tablet Daflon 500 mg one tablet a day for 14 days. Apply Pilex ointment or Hemoproct ointment before sleep in the anal region. Avoid anal sex if any until the fissure heals. Lastly, all acute fissure can be treated by the methods I have mentioned here and more than any medication follow the dietary advice and you can keep the fissure occurrence under control. However, if the fissure is persistent for more than two to three months it is better to get operated. Suggested operations are lateral internal sphincterotomy for the fissure and hemorrhoidectomy for piles. Also, keep a check on your viral load and Cd4 counts. I hope this helps.  ","Hello doctor,  I am 25 years old. I am suffering from fissure for the past one year but it is not healing properly. I am using Lox-2%, Osil and stool softener Softovac now regularly.

Hi. Medium sized painful ball attached to your testis can be inflammatory and painful. I understand the situation and hope to work up towards the right diagnosis and treatment. The different masses can be inflammation of epididymis which is above the testis or spermatocele which is a cyst containing sperms and it can be painful if infected. Abscess also can be near the testis and can cause pain. Hematoma blood collection beside testis results from trauma or injury. Other thing like torsion of testis means twist of testis and blockage of its blood supply is considered an emergency and needs an immediate operation. Ultrasound is diagnostic to confirm the mass and its type then we can decide about the treatment. I prefer you to go to a clinic near you to check preferably if they have ultrasound there then can be diagnosed properly.

"Hello. So there are two possibilities, one is peripheral neuropathy and the second is restless leg syndrome. Now do you have access to any of those tests or atleast knows what all tests were performed? Are you having any medications for that? I guess, you do not have any hormonal issues or did not receive any medications recently? There are certain causes we need to rule out besides diabetes like anemia or iron deficiency, thyroid problem, Vitamin B12 or Folic acid deficiency and liver or kidney disease, Vitamin D deficiency, and hypocalcemia. You may have some multivitamin supplements containing vitamin B12 like ME12OD or Neurobion forte etc, which may resolve this issue as vitamin deficiencies are quite common cause for the same.

"Hi. The most common reason for nose bleeds in children of this age group is 1. Frequent nose picking: We need to ascertain the cause of the nasal bleeds as the most common cause is secondary to dry nose and crusting which in turn causes irritation. Dry nose can be treated by using saline nasal drops four drops six times a day to ensure that the child's nasal mucosa is kept moist and does not dry up. In addition, I would also recommend the child not to get directly exposed to AC / fan as it can also dry up the nasal mucosa often. 2. Adenoid hypertrophy: Usually the adenoids increase in size and they can also be a reason for recurrent nasal bleeds. The child can be put on Mometasone nasal spray two puffs two times a day for the next coming three weeks. 3. Infection in the nose: This can also be another cause of recurrent crusting and inflammation in the nose which results in nasal bleeds. You can give her syrup Augmentin (Amoxicillin and Clavulanic acid) 228.5 mg 4ml three times a day after food for the next one week. It is better to treat all three possibilities for long term relief from the symptoms.

"Hello. Well, it seems that you have intestinal colic (spasm of intestine). The Entamizole (Diloxanide Furoate and Metronidazole) can work well if you have an infection otherwise not.

"Hi. Whenever we suffer an infection, our body’s immune mechanism comes into action. Those immune cells are nothing but WBCs (white blood corpuscles). So if the WBCs are high, then either there is an infection or the body is trying to fight bad cells in the body. WBCs are not the cause of infection. But it can cause fever by its actions. So whenever someone has a fever, it is very likely that they also have a high WBC count. There are different types of WBCs which increase/decrease in different situations. So the aim of doing blood tests is to see if only one type of WBCs are involved or there are multiple increased cell lines. Our diagnosis depends heavily on which type of WBCs are increased. So please put up the baby’s blood sample reports.  ","Hello doctor, My baby is 2 years old. She is having a high fever for two days now. Last month when she had a fever we found out that her WBC is so high. We tested her twice and the second test shows lower results but it is still not normal.

"Hello. Firstly it is a moderate to severe AR (aortic regurgitation) with normal heart function and normal LV dimension. So there is no significant damage to the heart. And also since you do not have symptoms of aortic regurgitation like palpitations or shortness of breath with exertion, serial monitoring with echo would be enough. Now regarding chest pain, it is unlikely to be cardiac. It is likely related to acid reflux which is diluted by drinking water. So you may have some antacid medications like Rabeprazole, Domperidone or Pantoprazole and Domperidone combination before breakfast for few days. You should also avoid spicy, oily, and hot foods as much as possible. Have light meals and walk for sometime after meals rather than resting immediately. Avoid too much tea or avoid caffeinated drinks. Now regarding heart rate, it is unusual for heart rate to go up this much with simple walking, however, with running it is expected. Also, one would certainly feel palpitations at this high heart rate. And arrhythmic tachycardia would have other associated symptoms like dizziness, shortness of breath, chest pain, etc. So it is probably an artefact, which is read as heartbeat by watch. It is better if you can wear a watch which also shows ECG tracings to confirm it or have 24-hour Holter monitoring to confirm it. Amtas is for blood pressure, not to control heartbeat so if your blood pressure is elevated then you may have it. So in a nutshell, it is probably artefactual rather true tachycardia, as it is unlikely for the heart rate to go above 150 with just walking. However, if one is too breathless during walking or has severe low hemoglobin or hyperthyroidism with baseline elevated heart rate of more than 100 bpm then it may or otherwise not. I hope this helps.  ","Hi doctor, My history: I am a patient of aortic regurgitation (moderate-severe) with a bicuspid valve. SB III (as per my last checkup). My question is, many times I feel a sudden sharp shooting pain in the middle and slight left of the chest which shortens the breath and gets normal within a few seconds (drinking water helps in to be able to breathe at this time). Also, I wear a MI fit to track the heart rate while walking. Even when not walking too fast, my heart rate touches 165 bpm. Is this normal? I am suggested to take Amtas 2.5 but I have not too it so far. Please help."
"Hello. I can imagine the level of your frustration for your chronic unresolving symptoms. And I really feel sorry to hear that you been back and forth around doctors for solution of your symptoms. Well, I can very well understand your problem, I will explain to you point by point.  1. Lax LES (lower esophageal sphincter) is not a uncommon findings on endoscopy. It reflects that the valve which controls reflux from stomach to lower part of food pipe is little bit open. However, your endoscopy did not show any ulcer formation in the food pipe which suggest you do not have Gastroesophageal reflux (GERD). Again your symptoms are not related to GERD. It is something else. I tell in a moment.  2. So you see the fundal gastritis (inflammation of the fundus- a part of stomach). Usually inflammation of stomach confines to the other parts of stomach -like antrum and stomach body, but not to the fundus. The one cause of inflammation predominantly to the fundus suggest H pylori infection. This bug initially infect antrum of the stomach then it moves to fundus if chronic infection that has not been treated. I will suggest you investigation before I suggest you an antibiotic course of this H pylori. And remember this H pylori can cause stomach slowing leading to your symptoms of gas. The condition is called gastroparesis. Below I explain to you in more detail the reasons of your symptoms of gas.  3. To simplify the constellation of your symptoms, we doctors classify in to two- the predominant gaseous symptoms or predominantly pain symptoms. You have predominantly gaseous symptoms including bloating, sounds, burping, fullness, early satiety after meals, and some gas in stools as well.  So it is important you should understand why these gases production is in excess in you. The one such reason is: i) Dysbiosis-which is alteration of human gut bacteria more gas producing species. These bacteria or harmlessly present in the human gut, however; at times the environmental factors, food, water, other dietary habits; change the composition of these bacteria and turn them in to gas producing bacteria. I will give you an antibiotic for a 3 week duration, this will correct your dysbiosis. ii) The other reason is excessive of food intake that produces gases. These foods are collectively called as FODMAPs. These foods to be avoided as possible as you can. I will share with you a link where you will find the list of such foods which should be avoided. iii) Less common mechanism is feeling of normal amount of gases-this condition is called hypersensitive gut. For this I would suggest you behavioral therapy called diaphragmatic breathing. I will share you the link how you can exercise it at your home.  I really hope now you would the some idea of mechanism causing your chronic unresolving symptoms.

"Hi. I understand your anxiety. The fortune thing is that even if last year HPV was present the treatment has been done in the form of hysterectomy. In fact it is over treated. I do not think it is a matter of concern.  For your vaginal HPV, low risk types are rarely responsible for any cancer. Also If one is sexually active, HPV infection keeps coming and body deals with it by its own immunity. What should concern us is a persistent HPV infection in your vaginal smears. So right now just use barrier contraception like condoms and repeat vaginal smear at 6 months. That is all. Follow up is what is needed as you are a very low risk case.  ","Hi doctor, I was HPV 16 positivethree years back. Follow up Pap a year later showed positive for HPV 16 again.

"Hi. This is definitely a dermoid cyst sinus. This lesion typically presents as a small opening (sinus) at birth and as the child grows the wall lining in the cyst accumulates sebaceous material which can get secondarily infected, resulting in swelling and then a discharge. In very few cases, the sinus disappears as age progresses. The infection has to be treated with antibiotics and once the infection subsides this cyst along with the enter sinus tract has to be excised under general anesthesia. For now, you can give her an antibiotic containing Amoxicillin with Potassium clavulanate 475 mg 4 ml three times a day for one week. In addition syrup Ibugesic plus (or its equivalent) 4 ml two times a day for one week to reduce the inflammation and pain. I think, for now, this should be sufficient. Please do not go to puncture or do anything to the swelling as it can flare up the infection and inflammation. I hope this helps.

The pain of intestinal loops affecting the cecum a part of large bowel or terminal ileum which is small bowel. The causes are many but given your age, there are possibilities of Crohn's, yersinia infection or Whipple, and lastly uncommon is intestinal tuberculosis. The other possibility is renal stones.

Thirdly, functional abdominal pain syndrome which is basically hypersensitivity of the intestine to food, stools, water, etc. This pain cannot cause weight loss however, the causes mentioned above can cause fever and weight loss.

This corbohydrates are fermented by small bowel.bacteria and produces excessive gases..one such example is milk and wheat grains and barley rye etc. You have to cut them to half before excessive production of gases can be prevented. At least you should try avoiding milk and milk based dairy production such as coffee, tea, icecream, and sweets. You can learn more about the foods who are carbohydrated and who freqeuntly cause excessive gas production on the internet. 2. Dysbiosis. Excessive of gas producing bacteria and lack of lactobacillus which help digest corbohydrats. This altered composition of bacteria is due to many factors namely oast use of antibiotic use, enviormental influence, sorts of diet one take and water one take. The one way is to treat this dysbiosis with a 10 day antibiotic course -Tab Rifaximin 500 mg twice daily for 10 days.

"Hi! There is a high probability that you would have accidentally injured the ear drum while cleaning. This is a very common thing to happen and you don't have worry too much. The defect in the ear drum interferes with optimum sound transmission to the middle and inner ear and thereby you will have symptoms such as continuous ringing sensations, muffled sounds, echoing of your own voice or any loud sound, intolerance to high frequency sounds, decreased hearing etc. Usually over 4 to 6 weeks this traumatic perforation heals and you will be completely fine. However, you shouldn't let it get infected as it can interfere with the healing process and if proper hygiene is not maintained the perforation might never close. My advice for you would be to  There is no medication required here as such unless your having an infection associated with copius amount of discharge. I hope I have answered your query in detail.

And as it is just a screening tests, it can not always diagnose if you have any foci of cancer over the cervix. it just give characteristics of the cells which were studied on the smears. So unless they are overtly cancerous looking, we always try to rule that out by doing other tests, So next comes the HPV ( Human Papilloma Virus) testing. 2) HPV testing - It's a test to detect the causative agent of the cervical cancer, that is human Papilloma Virus, it's spread through sexual contact. Based on their genomic sequence, they can be categorised into various types. So warts are caused by the low risk type that is 6 & 11. where as there some 12 high risk types which can cause cervical cancer, so these are detected in the HPV testing ( Depending on your test done - as various tests have different sensitivity & specificity). Of these high risk majority are caused by Type 16 & 18. So once a women starts her sexual activity, almost 70- 80% women may have HPV infection but it gets cleared over 1-2years, so that is why we do not test it for women less than 30yrs ( I see you haven't mentioned your age).So as the HPV is a virus and it coming positive indicates higher risk of having precancerous changes or may be risk of cervical cancer in future, we need to see if any changes have already happened to substantiate the previous tests. So then comes the role of colposcopy. 3) Colposcopy - it's basically a test to visualise the cervix under huge magnification and to see for any deviation from normal, and to look for any changes over the cervix which can hint on being abnormal or precancerous, so that from that particular abnormal sites biopsies canbe taken and subjected to histopathological examination ( where a pathologist sees the tissue under microscope to look for any cancerous cell). So as your colposcopy finding are normal, your gynaec may call you repeat testing after 6-12months for repeat cytology & HPV testing. If the Repeat screening are negative twice then you can just follow the screening protocols routinely as other women. Please share the reports of your HPV & Pap smear so that I can go through & guide you through in case you any further doubts.  Hope the information helps you. Have a nice day.  ","About a month ago I had a Pap smear that came back abnormal, and was told I have hpv. My dr then did a colposcopy two weeks ago. I got a call today saying that it came back normal. What does this mean? Do I still have hpv? Do I just have low risk hpv? I have never experienced warts."
"Hi. If it is due to gastritis, you should go for endoscopy, until that time you can start tablet Pantakind DSR (Pantoprazole).  ","Hello doctor, For the last three years, my wife had an acute abdominal pain due to gastritis. All the blood reports, sonography reports, x-ray are normal. Please help."
"Hi. Looking into mother's problem, you have got both hypertension and diabetic under Insulin with hip pain. First of all we need to understand what is the association between the current problem and existing diseases. Once we understand why it is happening and try to find its link then it is easy to understand the diseases to diagnosis and help long term treatment preparation.Uncontrolled diabetes can affect the muscles and skeleton, leading to joint pain, nerve damage.There is a link between diabetes, arthritis, and joint pain. Both rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and type 1 diabetes are autoimmune disorders. In both cases, the immune system is attacking an otherwise healthy part of the body. According to Arthritis Foundation guidelines, losing 15 pounds can significantly improve the level of hip pain in a person with Osteoarthritis. So, I would recommend to do: 1. Radiography of hip joint Ap/Lateral view to assess OA changes. 2. RA Rheumatoid factor. 3. CRP-To assess condition of active joint inflammation and destruction. I will follow up with the report.  ","Hello doctor, My mother is having lower hip side pain for almost a week now. She is taking maintenance medicines for high blood pressure (Approvel) and 24 units of Insulin everyday. What could be causing the pain and can I give her pain reliever?"
"Hi. I would like to know how it started and progressed in detail. How it was with the said medicine? Please answer a few more questions. Is there any weakness of hands or leg or anywhere? Is there any abnormal sensation or loss of sensation? Is there any loss of muscle mass? Is there difficulty in swallowing, chewing? In which part of the body fasciculations started and then migrated to which part? Or it started all over the body simultaneously? Do you take any CNS stimulants such as coffee or any addiction or abuse of substance? What were the components of blood work? What is the content of medicine Lexapro? And how you were with Lexapro in terms of fasciculations?  ","Hi doctor,  I am a 20-year-old male. For the past seven months, I have had widespread muscle twitching. The most annoying ones occur in my eyelids. I am diagnosed with anxiety and OCD, and I took Lexapro for 90 days. A couple of days ago, I was instructed by my doctor to stop the Lexapro due to the feeling of being off-balance and some minor changes to my vision. I am terrified of having ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). Within the past few days, I have had the urge to clear my throat every few minutes. I do suffer from health anxiety. Please help."
Hi. Can you attach the picture of the lesion for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan? Please attach a picture of it.  ,"Hello doctor, I have a black patch on my back which is almost circular and is itching constantly. It has become quite big in the last three to four months. Can you please suggest what it could be and what I can do? It feels good when I put hot water on it. And it becomes very dry. It has a small line on its edges. The itching is happening continuously. It subsides a bit when I apply moisturizer. But the black patch seems to become darker."
"Hello. The problem you are suffering is a viral illness that is temporary. You also need to check for any triggers that cause the mucus to increase. If you started with a dry cough, there should be no mucus build-up anymore. The feeling in your throat may possibly be due to dryness of your membranes. Please double your water intake and you should notice a considerable change. You can also take a tablet Neksium 40 (Esomeprazole) on empty stomach in the morning so that any gastric irritation can be prevented by this.  ","Hello doctor, For the past three months, I was having a dry cough. I consulted a doctor who advised me Augmentin 625 mg, Grilinctus, Betadine gargle, and steam for five days. That gave me a lot but not full relief. I continued gargle and steam for some more time. Since then, the cough is reducing. But, some amount of mucus remains in my throat. Nothing comes out but keeps giving me a feeling of something there."
"Hello. I have gone through the CT report (attachment removed to protect patient identity). There are variations in the branching pattern, but this is fine to have. Many individuals have such a branching pattern without any consequences. Slight bulging was mentioned at ramification, but they also commented that it appears to be within normal limits. And such slight bulging would not cause pain or would not have any consequences unless there is any obstruction within it. Important is that there is no obstruction or abnormal course of left coronary artery. They have mentioned that the left coronary has a slightly high take off which is fine and unlikely to be responsible for symptoms or complications. So, as far as coronaries are concerned, they are unlikely to be responsible for his symptoms and unlikely to end up in any adverse consequences. Now I guess, he must have had an ECG and echo, which would give additional assurance to this. Now if according to symptoms, they are again not classical of heart. If they were cardiac then they would have certainly aggravated by activities. So unlikely to be a cardiac issue. Now considering his reflux issue, the first possibility should be considered of acid reflux and secondly of musculoskeletal even if there is no definitive demonstrable tenderness. Omeprazole may not be able to counteract reflux totally. So it is worthwhile to try locally acting agents like syrup Sucralfate and see if it helps. Light meals and some walking after meals. Locally acting agent Diclofenac gel may also be tried. I hope this helps.  ","Hello doctor, My 8-year-old son has been having chest pains since six months. He takes medication for acid reflux, anxiety, and asthma currently. We had a CT scan done but the doctor says it should nothing to be concerned about, however, some of the stuff in the report I feel is of concern and I am looking for clarification on some things. He is currently on Omeprazole, Levabuterol, Atomoxetine, Flovent, and Guanfacine."
"Hello. Firstly, as you had three episodes of menstrual bleed including the withdrawal bleed post-emergency contraceptive after you had intercourse in March, so it is unlikely that you would be pregnant due to your sexual encounter in March. As you have missed your menses now by four days and if you have been sexually active during this cycle as well, then you must rule out pregnancy first with a home urine pregnancy test kit. If negative, then the delay is most likely stress-induced and you should wait for at least five days to allow menses to start naturally. If not, then you would need an ultrasound pelvis to check for endometrial thickness which if more than 8 mm. You can be offered a withdrawal bleed with progesterones to resume your menses.  ","Hello doctor, I had unprotected sex last March but took emergency contraceptive afterward. Six days after, I had the bleeding associated with the emergency contraceptive. Two weeks after that, in the first week of April, I had my period for six days (my usual period lasts five to seven days). In May, I had five days of the period although the last two days were only very light bleeding. Now I was due for my period four days ago, but I still have not got it. What are the chances that I am pregnant and if not should I be worried about my late period?"

"Hello. Yes, that is correct. It seems you are allergic to bee sting. For an allergic reaction to develop, initial exposure must occur in order for your body to create an immune response to it. This might have happened a few months ago when you were stung before. Since there was already an exposure and established immune response, subsequent exposure may result in allergic reaction. Severe allergic reaction resulting in anaphylaxis may occur but most of the time allergic reaction is mild and not life threatening. Symptoms such as excessive skin reactions, including hives and itching and flushed or pale skin, low blood pressure, constriction of your airways and a swollen tongue or throat, difficulty breathing, weak and rapid pulse, nausea, vomiting or diarrhea and dizziness or fainting warrants immediate consult. I hope I was able to answer your concern. Is there anything else I can help you with?  ","Hello doctor, Few months ago I got stung by a bee in arm.

"Hello. Actually ice leads to transient sensitivity but actually has zero role upon your infection. It might be a gum propblem (periodontitis). Let me know if you notice visible stain and tartar on your tooth or it might be caries that leads to infection and sensitivity from the ice triggered the pain but infection was already there. Upload an image of the area for better perception. Applying clove is a good idea but chornic clove oil acts as irritant and lead to burning sensation (ulceration), it might add to the pain too if used for a long time. Please do not worry. Kindly answer my questions. Meanwhile, as we all are in a lockdown state, I can suggest you medication to ease your pain and manage the infection. So do not worry. Betadine mouthwash gargle in lukewarm water 2-3 times a day, capsule Sporidex 500 mg one capsule BD for 5 days, tablet Metrogyl 400 mg 1 tablet BD for 5 days, tablet Zerodol SP 1 tablet BD for 5 days, capsule Pan D 1 capsule BD before meal for 5 days. These medication are the safest and will work like miracle. But upload the image for confirming the diagnosis to prevent any future pain or discomfort. Caries or tartar depending upon the image.

This has caused disturbance in my sleep for the past few days.

"Hello. Genital molluscum is a viral infection but not caused by HIV virus. It is a sexually transmitted diseases and therefore usually spread from sexual route. Genital molluscum is considered to be a marker of HIV infection. Therefore, it is usually advised to rule out HIV infection in patients of genital molluscum. As you are having genital molluscum does not mean that you are having HIV infection. If you are practicing safe sexual practices then chances of HIV infection is minimal at least not because of sexual route.

,"When I started paroxetine(paxil) 20 mg for GAD, I had three side effects, two of which were common, difficulty sleeping and a lack of appetite. The two were manageable. As for the third, which was a mild muscle spasms in my cheeks. Feeling like muscle cheeks are sometimes tight then relaxes. This side effect lasted 4 years then disappeared. I think when I started exercising it helped disappearing that. Last year, as per my dr instructions I switched to paroxetine cr 25mg cause the paroxetine 20 mg was out of stock. For 3 months everything was perfect, after which I started to take my pill at night. By end of the month, suddenly I started feeling as if the medicine had went out of my body and taking it again. The old side effects of the cheeks muscles spasm are back stronger, adding to it the neck( back and front) muscle contractions non stop and stiffness sometimes due to the continuous contractions. Next month, only cheek spasms(continuous)disappeared completely. Throughout this period, the muscle spasms/contractions(continuous)were covering all the back and front neck muscles at the same time. Since 3 months ago, I began to feel the muscles of the back neck muscles getting smooth and slight improvement in the contractions. They are getting mild and slow. Also feeling like cracking sound in my back neck muscles maybe due to stifness. Moreover, the spasms in the muscles is now getting isolated. Sometimes back sometimes front neck not anymore all area at the same time. I would like to clarify to you that there are no defects or abnormal movements such as tics or jerking movements in my neck. Muscle spasms or contractions are not visual. Only me who can feel them. Things are improving slowly.

"Hello First of all, please know that ringing sensation is very common and prevalent. There are many suspected causes for ringing sensation in the ear. The most common ones being - wax impinging on the ear-drum, sudden, loud noise, moving into a quiet room from a noisy environment and so on. You say it started after a bath. Even water, soap, hair follicles within your ear, when come in contact with the ear-drum can cause such ringing sensation, although for a short duration. This might have even attracted your attention to a symptom which might have been there even before, but was not noticeable. Sometimes, the medications you are on also can cause this ringing sensation. To be honest, there are lots of causes but no sure way of evaluating it. So, my suggestion - try diverting your thoughts away from this and try concentrating on some other work. When your thoughts are deeply immersed in something else, you will realise that you can hear the ringing sensation only if you think about it. You can also listen to music with ear-phones, with the volume of your device between 30-60% to get your mind off it. But please don’t do this all day. Give a gap of atleast an hour after listening for about 30 minutes. Also, it will probably not bother you when you are involved in a conversation with somebody, keeping your mind off it. All said, there are certain rare causes also, which require systematic treatment, but I wouldn’t want you to worry about them right away. This symptom of yours has started all of a sudden and in all probability might disappear spontaneously as well. Do not get anxious reading about all the causes of ringing sensation on the Internet as it is bound to frighten you. Try the above methods and tell me after 24 hours if there was any improvement at all.  ",Good day  My situation started yesterday after taking a shower yesterday. I climbed out of the shower and noticed I had this high pitched ringing sound in my ears.

"Dear, Sending Love and healing energy from here! Looking into your problem ,one of the reason you have yourself mention that weight increased and had heel pain . You have said you were having hyperthyroidism and after medication you got recovered. Those patient having hyper also tend to go into hypo too. Since you were hyper and after medication your level decreased might be normal and with meditation it must have gone below the normal . In hypothyroidism, you may be gaining weight.You may fail to lose weight despite ramping up exercise and reducing calories. Neuropathy: Low levels of thyroid hormone can result in nerve damage, called neuropathy﻿ characterized by tingling and numbness in the extremities. A painful foot condition known as plantar fasciitis may also develop in your feet, caused by edema (fluid buildup) around the nerves. So i recommend you to do X ray of foot to see any bony spur . Check thyoid level TFT Precursor 1)Use Silicon Heel pad in your shoe to support your heel ,it helps reduces friction . I will follow up and plan treatment after those reports.

Coming to this point, I would recommend performing regular physical activity to help reinforce your back muscles and help relieve the muscle spasm. I would also recommend taking a muscle relaxant (Flexeril) to help reduce the muscle spasm.

"Hi. It is commom to have white spots over the enlarged tonsils. Unless the tonsil is inflammed or it is troubling you, it is not required for you to take any antibiotics or painkillers. You can follow the advice given below: 1. Salt water gargles atleast 8 to 10 times a day for 1 month.  2. Avoid oily spicy and cold food/beverages.  3. Keep sipping on boiled warm water every 3 hours. Tonsils have some crevices on it what we call as crypts, food particles can often get lodged in those crypts which often appear to be white spots. If there is excessive accumulation, over time they can get calcified to form stones what we call as tonsilloliths.

"Hi. I understand your worry about the swelling of the foreskin you covered with antibiotics with a single dose of Azithromycin and later with one week of Amoxicillin. If there is sexually transmitted disease it might come back for mainly two reasons. Firstly, incomplete treatment and insensitive antibiotics as you did not have a culture result, and secondly, not treating the sexual partner. Therefore, after completing the Amoxicillin no need for more antibiotics hopefully the foreskin swelling resolves. You will need STD (sexually transmitted disease) screening for you and your partner needs a vaginal swab. If you got pain like burning sensation while passing urine or swelling or urethral discharge then you will need to do urethral swab culture as well. The swelling of the foreskin and sticky discharge might have been caused by sexually transmitted disease as the condom was torn we do not have culture results as you started antibiotics before a culture of your urethra was sent. It is great that with Amoxicillin you are getting better. My suggestion is to complete the Amoxicillin course. Then to do the sexually transmitted diseases tests (STD screening) which is chlamydia testing by swab taken from urethra, gonorrhea testing, syphilis tests, trichomonas tests, human papillomavirus (HPV), herpes test, hepatitis B surface antigen test, hepatitis C test, HIV antibody and HIV antigen blood test for you and your partner. Those investigations will help diagnose and prevent future recurrence. No need for any more medications for now apart from the Amoxicillin you are currently on I would be pleased to follow you after tests result to inform for further treatment if required. Urethral swab for partner and STD screen for both and urethral swab of the patient in case symptomatic. STD (sexually transmitted disease).  ","Hello doctor, I had a condom tear while having sex. Two weeks later, I developed symptoms of pain and slight swelling in my right testicle, lower abdominal pain, and foreskin inflammation.

Further, my foreskin and penile glans have now become sticky to touch, like a stick note, although it is not moist. I had also developed rashes on my inner thigh. I consulted a doctor who prescribed me T Bact for my sticky and slightly swollen foreskin, Betnovate N for my rashes in my inner thighs, and put me on a seven-day course of Amoxicillin 500 mg for three days.

"Hello. Fertility medications cannot be prescribed without a thorough evaluation. This involves finding the exact cause of not being able to conceive whether it is female factors or the male factor. Among the female factor, ovulatory dysfunction is the most common cause. Also, tubal factors like tubal block can also cause difficulty in conceiving and thus need evaluation. I see that your previous cycles have been regular but this time you had a delayed cycle which is the first time you observed this. Delayed cycles indicate ovulatory dysfunction, which could be due to hormonal disturbance of thyroid or Prolactin Hormone, or due to a lifestyle condition like PCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome). Also, I see you are overweight for your height. I would like to know many more details about your issues, like if you have any acne issues or any unwanted facial hair growth. Was there any recent weight gain? What is the average coital frequency in a week? Do you have any vaginal discharge and frequent lower abdominal pain? Have you had tuberculosis or any other chronic medical conditions in the past? Have your husband got a semen analysis done, what is his age, and what does he do? As it is the third day of your periods today, you can get the below mentioned medical tests done and consult a fertility expert with reports for further evaluation and management. Treatment would depend on the underlying causes. In 10-20% of cases, there may not be any attributable causes. It is called unexplained infertility. In such cases, also your fertility expert may suggest assisted reproductive techniques to increase the chances of pregnancy. I hope this helps. Hemogram. Lipid profile. LFT (liver function test), RFT (renal function test). 75 g glucose tolerance test (fasting, 1 hour, 2 hour). HbA1c (glycated hemoglobin) levels. Serum calcium, Vitamin D and B12 levels. Serum fasting and Post prandial. Insulin levels.

Also know that the amount of milk secreted depends on: 1. How frequently the baby is offered breastfeed. 2. How well the baby is sucking. The milk secretion increases according to the baby’s demand. More sucking- more milk. 3. Mother’s diet. 4. The medications that the mother and baby are at present. Kindly give me the above details before you decide to stop breastfeeding completely. If you still want to know the best formula milk, there are many in the market like Cerelac, Lactogen, Nan, etc. Any of them will do. You should know the correct dilutions before feeding.

"Hello. It is good that you continued Ginette 35 (Cyproterone acetate and Ethinyl estradiol) till date. Your menses would have been regular after being placed on Ginette 35 till date as I presume. If you wish to conceive, then you must stop the pills after completing this pack and wait for the withdrawal bleed or menses. From the next cycle, you may try naturally and also follow up ovulation with ultrasound guided follicular monitoring. Sometimes, initial 1 or 2 cycles remain annular after prolonged usage of Ginette 35 and resumes by third cycle. But, that varies from woman to woman. So, you may try conception from next cycle and do follow ovulation.

"Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com. What are your symptoms exactly? If they are of depression, then the treatment with an SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) is ideally given for six months or so. Basically, if you are depressed, you will feel irritable, low, feel like crying, sad, do not wish to eat, have difficulty sleep, there can be anxiety, tiredness, headaches, etc. In bipolar illness, there will be a period of these depressive symptoms and then after a period of normalcy, the reverse happens. That is, you feel unusually happy for no reason, there are episodes of spending money excessively on things which you do not need, or maybe excessive use of alcohol, other illicit drugs, sex, irritable behavior, decreased need for sleep and still feeling fresh, grandiose talks and ideas, many non-goal directed activities, etc. So if you have not had the manic/hypomanic phase, then you probably suffered from major depressive disorder or generalized anxiety disorder.

"Hi. We have to first ascertain as to why sinusitis has occurred in the first place. Usually, in most cases, the primary cause is a seasonal or year around allergic problem that is there. Just to make you understand I have tried to explain things in a simple way below. Exposure to dust (or any irritative substance that your body is hypersensitive to) will initially initiate reflexes such as sneezing to remove the offending agent out but if this fails, mucosal cells in you nose start to hyperfunction producing loads of mucus to trap dust (owing to its sticky nature), this mucus has no where to go other than either being blown out of due to mucociliary activity gets pushed into the throat, thereby entering into a new zone. The throat initially reacts by activating cough impulses to push out the mucus, but if that fails, a local inflammation around the throat starts which often leads to symptoms such as feeling of a lump in the throat and repeated feeling to clear the throat. As far as your nose is concerned, due to long standing inflammation, the mucosa starts to get edematous and ends up forming a polyp. I know the problem is there since a long five years, but I am not sure if you have followed any specific treatment chart which is usually recommended before we consider any patient for surgery. This treatment chart is custom made according to your symptoms and does follow the guidelines to treat both allergy with sinusitis. The following things can be considered. 1. Wear an n95 mask at all times, do not allow any dust or irritative substance from entering into your nose. This is the most important thing you should be following failing which, no treatment will bring any relief. 2. Tablet Sinarest (Paracetamol + Phenylephrine hydrochloride + Chlorpheniramine maleate) one tablet twice daily after food 12 hours apart for 15 days. 3. Tablet Allegra M (Fexofenadine and Montelukast) one tablet twice daily after food 12 hours apart for 15 days. 4. Tablet Zerodol TH (Aceclofenac and Thiocolchicoside) 4mg (or its equivalent) one tablet twice daily after food for five days. 5. Tablet Clarithromycin 500 mg one tablet twice daily after food. 6. Duonase nasal spray (or its equivalent) two puffs two times a day in both nostrils for three months (do not inhale while you spray the drug). 7. Tablet Mucomix 600 mg (Acetylcysteine) one tablet twice daily for 1 week. 8. Tablet Wysolone (Prednisolone) 10 mg one tablet after breakfast for 10 days. 9. Steam inhalations 3 to 4 times a day. 10. Saltwater gargles at 8 to 10 times a day for one month. 11. Do not smoke or consume alcohol as it slows down mucociliary clearance mechanisms. All precautionary measures have to be followed strictly for maximum relief, otherwise, medications would not be useful on the long term. Surgery can be considered (if above medications and precautionary measures do not give any relief), but there is a catch to it. The symptoms might come back sometimes even on a higher scale after a brief relief following surgery if the precautionary measures post surgery are not followed. Ideally speaking in a nutshell, I again emphasis on preventing any irritative substance from entering the nose and throat, thereby triggering an allergic cascade of events and reproducing the symptoms you have mentioned above. As far as the polyp is concerned, in very few cases the polyp resolves on its own with medications and often the patient requires a surgery called functional endoscopic sinus surgery where the sinus openings are widened and the polyps are removed. You will have to get a CT scan done to see the extent of the polyp, current condition of the other sinuses and anatomical variations in the nose which could have been contributing to the polyp. I hope this helps.  ","Hi doctor, I am a 31-year-old male. I have sinusitis for almost five years. Also, there is polyp formation in the right maxillary sinus.

"Hello. Well, your US (ultrasound) and CT (computed tomography) scan are normal which is kind of satisfying to me. Of course you suppose to have more blood tests to confirm the origin of this jaundice. Hepatitis, although common, but they are not the only one to cause liver problem there are many other causes such as nonhepatotrophic virus infections as herpes virus, Ebstein Barr virus, cytomegalovirus. Non-viral causes are Wilson hemochromatosis, alpha-1 trypsin deficiency. The causes of predominantly raised bilirubin (jaundice) with normal CT scan suggest microscopic primary sclerosing cholangitis, primary biliary cholangitis benign and progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis. The hepatologist will start from blood tests first and at times can be recommended liver biopsy if the blood test does not serve the purpose.

"Hello. So starting from answering your first question. The pain of twisting of veins is an strange term in itself. Why would veins twist around in a healthy young lady with no previous significant medical history. So I do not believe this. Second, the gall bladder is not removed in asymptomatic gall stones. Asymptomatic gall stones are those which do not cause symptoms, and the symptoms of gall stones occur usually when the stone size is 10 mm, if smaller than this, it is unlikely that your pain was gall stone related. Since you did not mention size of gall stones, otherwise it would have been easy to tell you whether it was cause of your pain or not. Other, the pain of gall stones has to be typical in nature; the pain which occur in right upper quadrant of the abdomen (at site of your liver), pain starts suddenly mostly after half hour of meals, peaks within 1 hours, and then starts settling in next 4 to 6 hours. Vomiting and nausea can frequently accompany with this pain. If you have that typical type of pain, then it may be from gall bladder. Your third question. The answer is no. No drug therapy can prevent from formation of stones or dissolution of stone. There are some therapies which are used as in experience, but they are not recommended at all. If gall bladders stones are symptomatic then they has to be removed by doing gall bladder resection via laparoscopy. If not symptomatic, then no need of any drug or surgical therapy. Having said that, elective gall bladder resection is indicated among patients who could not bear the risk of cholecystitis, such as pregnant ladies with size of stones more than 10 mm, or patients with smaller gallbladder stones but having pancreatitis. Stone but without symptoms and presence of gall bladder polyps. These three types of patients can have surgery despite no symptoms.

Now my right ear has lost hearing, I would estimate about 50% and fluctuates between 50% to 75% during the day. When it is totally silent, I think I hear this tone in my right ear. I do not have headaches and can sleep fine. I have gingivitis and bleeding gums, and no other health issues. I was wondering if my ear is infected or not. I know whatever I have is connected to my frequent flying every two months for the last five years. I always wore earplugs and never had this before but forgot the last trip. Should I take antibiotic drops? I definitely have mucus in my sinus and I am not sneezing or coughing in any major way just and not sure if I am infected or not. Would antibiotic drops help me rule out infection?"
"Hi,  Welcome to icliniq.com.  It looks that you are suffering from acute urticaria. This could happen as a result of an allergic reaction to blanket dust or furs in it. There are other causes as well. Is this the first episode? Or you get them frequently? Any history of diabetes or thyroid? Any history of any medicine taken recently for some other issues? Until you reply, you can take Clairtin (Loratidine) dose again. No problem with that. I hope this helps.  ","Hello doctor, I am a 17-year-old female. I believe that I have hives on my thighs. I have them for about five to six days and they appear whenever the area gets hot. I was using a blanket last night and the hives got red again but when it is cold, they are not red and appear to be my skin color. I used Hydrocortisone the first three days and it helped, and I was also wearing tight leggings while working all day. The last two days, I have been taking Claritin and it has helped because the area is no longer itchy but the hives and bumps are still there. Should I take Claritin tonight too? How do I get rid of the bumps? I assume that I should not keep on using Claritin since I have used it for two days already."
"Hi. I appreciate your efforts of going into the details about puberty and its effects on the body. You have done quite a bit of research. You only need to understand a few more things. First, not everybody’s body responds the same way to puberty. The genetic makeup has a big influence on it. Your final height depends on your parents’ height, lifestyle diet, physical exercise, and also mildly influenced by the mindset and environmental factors. Generally, boys grow up to 18-20 years of age unless the growth is arrested by early puberty. By your description, your puberty is just setting in, which is normal for the age. Now, your final height will depend on your diet and physical activity. It is possible that you might add another 4-5 inches to your height.  ","Hi doctor, I am 13 years old. I have been curious about puberty and height. I am currently 5 feet 6 inches and really insecure about my body and height. I feel very hairy and fair. I have been researching tanner stages of development and I am around tanner stage 4. I have hair around my inner thighs, I can grow a slight mustache in three weeks, I have line of hair from my testicles to my belly button forming. I have little hair around my nipple and some hair on my underarms. I have lots of leg hair and a medium amount of arm hair, my penis is 6.5 inches erect and 4 inches flaccid. I have attached a photo. I wear a shoe size of 11. How tall can I expect to be and how far into puberty really am I? I also have hairy parents."
"Hello. There are many conditions where we can get chest pain along with ribs pain. I would like to ask a few questions. Is that pain on costochondral junction which means if you palpate your ribs you can feel there is one gap and then the other rib is started. So pain in that region is costochondritis but the pain is like neurogenic pain sharp and localized (at specific). Does that pain radiates to the tip of shoulder or not? Is the pain associated with other symptoms like palpitation? Had you done exercise one day before and got pain? Meanwhile, I would recommend you start one drug and let us work on your problem. Also, remember anxiety and panic attacks can cause symptoms very similar to angina. These attacks which can occur out of the blue or in response to a stressful event include chest pain along with shortness of breath, palpitations, and dizziness. Take tablet Parafon Forte (Chlorzoxazone) 500 mg per oral three daily after food for three days. This prescription for you helps relax certain muscles in your body and relieve the discomfort caused by acute (short-term), painful muscle, or bone conditions.

I tried putting a heating pad and ice pack on it and did not do anything. I feel extreme discomfort, cannot take deep breathes, and feel sharp stabbing pain once in a while."
"Hi. After reviewing your history, it seems to me Peyronie’s disease but I need pictures (flaccid, partial, and complete erection) from you to confirm it. Presentation is secondary to fibrosis in tunica Albuginea causing curvature of penis on erection to variable degrees. It starts with inflammation and pain but will stabilize and become painless with time over approximately six months. Its causing factors are not exactly known but related to microvascular injury and healing with fibrosis is more common in diabetics and might be secondary to autoimmune diseases. Diagnosis is made purely on clinical grounds by history examination and pictures. Treatment ranges from medications to local injections to surgery which is reserved for significant deformity and curvature. I would be grateful to further diagnose and follow up on you. Please send me pictures to support the diagnosis before I make a strategy for your treatment. Provide pictures.  ","Hello doctor, I am a 24-year-old male. I have noticed that my penis gets really narrow in the middle like an hourglass and bends in a weird way when half erect or in the process of getting erect. It gets completely normal when fully erect though and there is no pain. This happens once every few days. Should I be worried? I have tried searching online and the closest result is Peyronie's. However, in Peyronie's the erect penis gets the hourglass shape with pain but in my case erections are just fine. Any help would be greatly appreciated as I am quite worried."

"Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help.

"Hi. I can understand your concern. According to your statement, you have been suffering from back pain and hypertriglyceridemia with low HDL (high density lipoprotein) level. You have a high VLDL (very level density lipoprotein) level too. For your abnormal lipid profile level, you should avoid fatty foods and dairy products. You can take Fenofibrate for your high triglycerides level along with Omega-3 fatty acid for your low HDL level. Continue these medications for abnormal lipid profile and do repeat your lipid profile after three months later. For your back pain, you can take Naproxen with Baclofen, Calcium with vitamin D supplements. So you can continue the medications as follows. Capsule Lofibra (Fenofibrate) 200 mg 0+0+1 (after meal), tablet Naprosyn 500 mg 1+0+1 (after meal) for 10 days, tablet Lioresal (Baclofen) 10 mg 1+0+1 for one month, tablet Carbocal D 400 0+1+0 for two months, capsule Bio Marine, Omega-3, and Fish oil 0+1+0 (continue), tablet Prevacid (Lansoprazole) 30 mg 1+0+0 (before meal) for one month.

"Hi. According to the report you have sent (attachment removed to protect patient identity), the child has left-sided undescended testis. It is a common practice to wait until the baby is six months old before operating. There is a small chance that the testis might descend on its own by six months. They usually do not descend after six months and also the risk of that testis becoming nonfunctional if waited beyond six months is high. Another thing is, there is a small risk of that testis becoming cancerous if it is not operated within one year. So, your child will need a surgery orchidopexy by about six months of age if it does not descend spontaneously. Follow up at 6 months of age.  ","Hello doctor, My 40-day-old son's left testis is undescended. Sonography shows his testis on the upper end of the inguinal canal. Please suggest whether it will come down naturally."
"Hello. I can understand your concern about symptoms complex and ultrasound findings and whether surgery is the answer to your problem. Well, first of all, I want to clear that you do not have stones in the gallbladder. They are concretions. It is a medical term and they are called microlithiasis (gall bladder stones less than 3 mm in size). So the possibility of developing cholecystitis (gall bladder inflammation) is very low. However, this microlithiasis can cause pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas which is a gland sitting over the back of the abdomen). Thirdly, the pain can be secondary to the functional gall bladder problem, where the gall bladder is naturally slow resulting in damping of bile (yellow secretion produced by the liver and stored within gallbladder) and production of small concretions such as in y our case. So I would ask you to get a few blood tests to confirm whether you have pain due to pancreatitis. I also want that you should discuss to me in more detail about your pain, as only proper history can give me a clue towards your problem whether gall bladder inflammation, pancreatitis, or functional gall bladder disorder even before any further testing. Since the ultrasound findings and your symptoms are not correlated very well, there is no point in discussing the role of surgery. But I just want to assure you that you probably need no surgery, so do not worry about it. I suggest you some tests, please get it done, then I would recommend you some lifestyle changes and a medical treatment that can help you resolve your minor stones within the gallbladder. I hope this helps. Pancreatitis. Cholecystitis. Peptic ulcer disease. Functional gallbladder disorder (gallbladder dyskinesia). Complete blood count. Serum amylase and lipase. Liver function tests. TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone). Start capsule Esomeprazole 40 mg half an hour before meals once daily for now. Follow up after investigation.  ","Hello doctor, My friend is having a gall bladder stone. We consulted few doctors, some are saying the immediate operation is needed otherwise it will be cancerous and some are saying no immediate action is required. She is having pain in her right side of the upper abdomen and also in the middle. I am attaching her ultrasound report. Please tell me about her condition. During this pandemic, we are not able to go outside and consult the doctor."
"Hello. I have gone through your reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Your lipid profile and liver enzyme ALT are deranged and Vitamin D is low. For low Vitamin D, you should have tablet Uprise D3 (or Calcirol sachet) 60,000 units once a week with milk for eight weeks. After eight weeks, you should have it once a month for the next six months. Now the liver enzyme is deranged likely due to fatty liver, which is related to deranged lipid profile. You should get an ultrasound of liver to confirm it. Now since LDL (low density lipoprotein) is moderately elevated, you may give a try of a healthy lifestyle. So you should have a healthy lifestyle like avoiding fatty, oily, high calorie foods. Avoid fried, fast food, egg yellow, non veg consumption, and avoid excessive oil. Do not reuse the cooking oil once used for frying. Have regular exercises like brisk walking or running according to the capacity for atleast 30 minutes a day. Repeat lipid profile after eight weeks and if there is a response then should continue a healthy lifestyle or else will medications like tablet Atorva (Atorvastatin) 10 mg bedtime once daily for six to eight weeks. I hope this helps.  ","Hello doctor, I am 39 years old. Recently I have done some health check ups. The report shows my LDL cholesterol is 140, Triglycerides -165, HDL-30. Should I take any medicine?

"Hi. If your gut is not normal, it will definitely affect your skin. First thing, include a lot of probiotics in your diet. Take two cups of curd daily. Have small frequent meals like two to three hours eat something. Your meal should be breakfast, lunch, and dinner with two intermittent snacks. Include ghee every day in your diet. Add one or two teaspoons ghee with rice along with other accompaniments. Stop the Cod liver capsules completely. Supplements should not be taken for years together. Occasionally if you eat homemade sweets, nothing will happen. You can take it as your weight is very low. For in-between snacks, you can eat fruits, buttermilk (include every day), protein powder in the evening, channa, etc. Always have protein-rich foods in the morning hours and the later meal should be light. Avoid breads, bakery products, processed foods, sodas, rich sweets, junks, etc. Get a complete blood test done. Follow up after a week with your reports.

"Hello. The pain you have been experiencing is most likely the ovulatory pain, typical to occur in the midcycle when one has regular cycles of 28-30 days, or if you have you menstrual periods of varying dates, you can observe that exactly 14 days prior to the menstrual period. It is called Mitterschmerz syndrome or pain. It is a normal phenomenon and usually mild but rarely it can be severe. As your pain has been severe today, it would be better to get an ultrasound done to rule out any other causes of your pain. If you had mentioned the date of your last menstrual periods, it would have been helpful. You can take antispasmodic medications and see if the pain gets relieved, But if it does not, then it would be better to seek emergency medical help. And I am assuming that chances of pregnancy have been ruled out, if not then please evaluate yourself (just in case if sexually active). I hope this helps.  ","Hello doctor, I am 18 years old.

"Hello. Looking into your x-ray pictures (attachment removed to protect patient identity) and reading your problem, I got to know about linear undisplaced fracture of the talus.

The bone also helps in the movements of the ankle, and together with the calcaneus facilitates the movements of the foot.

"Hello , I am sorry to hear about your situation. I can imagine how hard it must be for you. In your query you have not mentioned the diagnosis so I can't suggest exactly what needs to be done but I will explain how it works .. The fact that you mentioned that she doesn't remember anyone could be a part of 1. Dementia for which you would require a neurologist , Medications can help to an extent . 2. Psychosis or Depression can have such reactions , you will require a Psychiatrist for this . A complete evaluation is required , the doctor might do a CT/ MRI depending on the symptoms and start treatment accordingly and yes Medications can help to an extent depending on severity of the issue.

"Hi. I can understand your concern. According to your statement, you have been suffering from back pain, tiredness, more sleepy feeling, and inflammation on foot. I have gone through your investigations (attachment removed to protect patient identity) result and found that your Vitamin D3 level is below normal, GGT (gamma-glutamyl transferase) level slightly high, HDL (high dentisy lipoprotein) level below normal, TG (thyroglobulin) and VLDL (very density lipoprotein) level significantly high, TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) level normal at the upper limit. Total leucocyte count with lymphocytes count slightly high, eosinophil count are significantly high. So your back pain, tiredness, more sleepy feeling with inflammation of foot may result from vitamin D3 deficiency. Clinical features of vitamin D3 deficiency are repeated infections, tiredness, back pain, depression, bone pain, muscle pain, fatigue, delayed wound healing, feeling sleepy, etc. Again high TG levels may cause abdominal pain, loss of appetite, nausea or vomiting, tiredness, fatigue, etc. Your high eosinophil count indicates that you may suffer from allergies. As your TSH level is normal at a higher limit, so you should repeat the thyroid function test within three months. For your vitamin D3 deficiency, you should need more exposure to sunlight for vitamin D3 synthesis as well as take vitamin D3 enriched foods and supplements. For your high TG level, you should continue Fenofibrate along with Omega-3 fatty acid for low HDL level and repeat your lipid profile test after three months. For your low back pain, you can take Naproxen with Esmoprazole combination with Baclofen and calcium supplements.
